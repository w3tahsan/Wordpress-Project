She later joined her first WordCamp in Ahmedabad, India. This three day event in 2017 opened up a new world—the WordPress community—and what would become a life changing moment. “WordCamp Ahmedabad has one of the best WordPress communities in India,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and everyone, including organizers and attendees were so humble and welcoming.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pooja600x600.jpg?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9654\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pooja600x600.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pooja600x600.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pooja600x600.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The thirst for learning</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A fascination with how things worked and a desire never stop learning were traits that shone through in Pooja from a young age. She moved from Banera, a rural village in India, to a nearby city, where she lived with her uncle while completing her higher education. With her enthusiasm for learning, she decided to become an engineer. When thinking back on that time she says, “Being from a rural background, people in my village tended not to be keen on the idea of sending their girl child to another city for further studies. Fortunately, that was not the case for me because my parents were immensely supportive of me and my interests. They’ve always encouraged me to believe in myself and fulfill my dreams. With their support, I pursued my engineering in electronics and communication.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Discovering the opportunities in web development&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On completing her engineering training, Pooja was not sure what to do next. One of her friends suggested that she should explore web development. The idea intrigued her, and she sought out learning resources to study. She also secured an internship as a PHP Developer to give herself the chance to learn alongside professionals in the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Getting started with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p><strong>“I found WordPress surpassed other platforms. The vast knowledge base made it easy for me to learn.” &#8211; Pooja</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This internship led Pooja to her first job where she discovered a range of content management systems. Her view of the opportunities offered by these systems changed when the manager assigned her a small project using the WordPress platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recalls: “I found WordPress surpassed other platforms I had worked on earlier. The vast knowledge base made it easy for me to learn.” She soon became comfortable managing WordPress, working with plugins and themes, and wanted to learn it more in-depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja soon joined WPVibes as its first team member. Being part of a new startup gave her a lot of experience and a chance to be involved in new processes. As the company expanded they started providing custom plugin development services per the client’s requirement and created some free and paid plugins. Pooja said, &#8220;We found it very exciting and productive. Today, we are a team of 10.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Encouragement from the WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p><strong>Contributing to WordPress increases your knowledge</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At the event, she was able to listen to speakers from India and abroad, many of whom shared their journey with WordPress and how it had changed their lives. “One of the most inspiring sessions was by Rahul Bansal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He talked about contributing to WordPress and giving back to the community. He also explained how contributing to WordPress can help you to enhance your knowledge. It inspired me to contribute to WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community of Ahmedabad continued to inspire Pooja and her husband Anand Upadhyay, and they later started a Meetup group in their home city of Ajmer as part of their contribution to the community. They continue to be involved in supporting local users through the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/ajmer-wordpress-meetup/\">Ajmer Meetup</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KmA8iDgGrRar_cgD2jp2ThrzPxuzGTSI7SWkxDdHKyN4p2iNoj0e-VdOxO0xa1TtH56Uci9wEfYYfnW8DYji8c1HuaI7L-xhNqXyXt_kdchWtVxe_PnSea2knlWhP_O7qqG0Quju\" alt=\"Pooja with a WordCamp Ahmedabad badge\" width=\"500\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the next WordCamp Pooja attended, she joined its contributor day, which brings users together to give back to the open source platform and global community. Most of the contributors she met were interested in giving time to the WordPress CMS. She decided to venture into a different path and took her first steps by joining the WordPress TV group, where you can explore videos from WordPress events across the world. She also discovered the joy of translating into her local language, and is a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglot</a> contributor for the Hindi language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, she was selected as a volunteer for WordCamp Asia in Bangkok, Thailand, and it became an impetus to become even more involved with the community. She was very excited about this role, and to be part of her first WordCamp outside India. Sadly, due to the global COVID pandemic, the event had to be cancelled. Her enthusiasm has not diminished and she is eagerly waiting to support in-person WordCamps in the future and meet even more members of the global community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her determination to be part of making WordPress and sharing skills has only increased, which has led to contribute to the WordPress Training team. This team manages lesson plans and prepares content to support people who are training others to use WordPress. The team recently joined a few other teams to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/introducing-learn-wordpress/\">launch Learn WordPress</a>, which brings learning materials together for users of all levels, and Pooja contributed to two different teams during the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Message to the WordPress Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja is eager to share her belief in the power for good in the WordPress community. “There is a huge community to help you with your learning, so start learning and try to give back to the community. It doesn’t matter if you are not comfortable with programming, there are many different ways in which you can contribute.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What I have learned in my life is that it doesn’t matter from where you came and what background you have. All that matters is your hard work and positive attitude towards life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more stories in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/heropress/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>) and Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>) for writing this story, and to Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\">@sthakor</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">@cbringmann</a>), Olga Glekler (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/oglekler/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>oglekler</a>), Christopher Churchill (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/vimes1984/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>vimes1984</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), and Yvette Sonneveld (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\">@yvettesonneveld</a>) for work on the series this month.

The proposal is aimed at locations that have more effectively contained COVID-19 (such as New Zealand and Taiwan, for instance) so that local meetup groups in these areas can organize safe, in-person events. According to the proposal, in-person meetup organizers should review local/global health instructions based on resources and complete a checklist — which recommends whether to organize an event or not based on the organizer’s inputs and other factors. Compulsory safety precautions should be taken for any in-person meetup, and participants/organizers can share event feedback with WordCamp Central. The proposal is still being discussed, so if you have any thoughts, please<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/01/26/proposal-update-decision-making-checklist-for-safe-in-person-meetups/\"> share them in the comments</a>. <strong>Please note: WordPress meetups and WordCamps are still online at this time and will continue to remain online until further notice.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved with the Community team? <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Follow the Community blog</a>, or join them in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQC7RN\">#community-events</a> channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

Version 9.7 allows users to drag block patterns from the inserter right into a desired position within the editor. It also has a new block variations feature and several improvements to reusable blocks. Version 9.6 makes the spacer block semi-transparent, adds a variation icon to the block switcher, adds site editor content to an iframe, and stabilizes Full Site Editing (FSE) by removing the auto drafts feature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building Gutenberg?

Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 5.7 Beta 1 in two ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Install/activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the&nbsp;<code>Bleeding edge</code>&nbsp;channel and the&nbsp;<code>Beta/RC Only</code> stream)</li><li>Direct download the beta version here (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.7-beta1.zip\">zip</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for final release is March 9, 2021. That’s just <strong>five weeks away</strong>, so your help is vital to making sure that the final release is as good as it can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s new? <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f914.png\" alt=\"🤔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Improvements in Core</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lazy-load iframes</strong><br>Now you can enable lazy-loading of iframes by adding the <code>loading=\"lazy\"</code> attribute to iframe tags on the front-end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Migrating from HTTP to HTTPS is streamlined</strong><br>Switching a WordPress site from HTTP to HTTPS has proven to be a pain for all involved. While on the surface, the Site Address and WordPress Address have to be updated, content with embedded HTTP URLs remains unchanged in the database. With this release, migrating a site to HTTPS is now a one-click interaction. URLs in the database are automatically replaced when the Site and WordPress Address are both using HTTPS.&nbsp; Also, Site Health now includes an HTTPS status check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Standardize colors used in WP-Admin CSS to a single palette</strong><br>This change collapses all colors used in the CSS to one of the available shades of blue, green, red, yellow, grey, black, and white. The palette makes it simpler than ever to build components your users can read, because half the range gives you great contrast with white type and a half with black, according to current accessibility guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ongoing cleanup after update to jQuery 3.5.1</strong><br>jQuery deprecations in WordPress Core and bundled themes show up a lot less often, and the notifications make more sense to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New Robots API</strong><br>The new Robots API allows the filter directives to be included in the ‘robots’ meta tag. Also, the directive <code>max-image-preview:large</code> is now included by default to allow large image previews to be displayed in search engines (unless the blog is marked as not being public).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Improvements in the Editor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Inserter drag and drop: Blocks and block patterns can now be dragged directly from the inserter into the post canvas.</li><li>Full height alignment: Blocks such as the Cover block now can have an option to expand to fill the entire viewport.</li><li>Block variations: The icon and description of a block variation is now shown in the block inspector, and a new dropdown in the block inspector lets you switch between block variations.</li><li>Reusable blocks: Several enhancements to the usability and stability of reusable blocks have been made, and reusable blocks are now saved at the same time that the post is saved.</li><li>Buttons block: The Buttons block now supports vertical alignments, and you can set the width of a button to a preset percentage.</li><li>Social Icons block: You can now change the size of the icons in the Social Icons block.</li><li>Font size in more places: You can now change the font size in the List and Code blocks.</li><li>Many many other enhancements and bug fixes.

In High School, she pursued a career in Computer Science. She said: “I did not know what I would be doing or how I would get there but I just knew that I was going to pursue a career in information technology.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She wrote her first line of code at the age of 16 living in Zimbabwe, Africa. This was to mark the beginning of her enthusiasm for computer programming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she joined the school’s computer class, Thelma thought she would learn Excel and Word. Instead, the assignment was to write her first program in C. She said: “It was not easy, but it was very exciting. l remember writing up simple code for a Video Club – a check-in/out for VHS tapes and CDs. Thus began my fascination with computers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seven years later, she went on to university to study for a Bachelors in Business Management and Information Technology. Her third year internship was at a local web design and hosting company. Though she had hoped her placement would be at a local bank or telecommunications company, the chance to discover website design turned out to be the best thing that could have happened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, Thelma went on to work for a company designing websites using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and Joomla. She had heard about WordPress but had not used it. She recalls: “People have this misconception that WordPress is not for real developers and it is not secure and at that time I was one of those people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding a local community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a discussion with a member of the local WordPress community, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-opened-whole-new-world/\">Thabo Tswana</a>, about a striking swag gift from a WordCamp, Thelma’s interest was sparked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She started to find out more about WordPress and WooCommerce, and visited her local WordCamp Harare website. She was delighted to find that she could learn more about WordPress without needing any pre-existing knowledge, and wanted to be involved. So instead of just attending the camp, she volunteered too!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her response to her first WordPress event mirrors the experience of many others in the community. She said: “I only started using WordPress because of the awesome people that l had met at that WordCamp. Everyone was so welcoming.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A week later, with help from Thabo, she designed her first website using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She soon became more involved with the community and Meetups. Thelma participated in the first-ever ‘Women Who WordPress’ Meetup in 2018, with lots of women getting involved from bloggers to developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “We were free to talk and discuss a lot of things. We had more time to discuss the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org, we shared views on how to handle discrimination at work, how to promote your website and a whole lot of other things.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Establishing roots in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, WordCamp Harare had its first-ever female Lead Organizer <a href=\"https://tapiwanashe.com/\">Tapiwanashe Manhobo</a>. Thelma was part of the organising team that year and was assigned to handle Harare’s first Kids Camp to take place eight months later. You can read more about her experiences of organizing a <a href=\"https://thelmachido.wordpress.com/2019/11/21/wordpress-juniours-first-edition/\"><strong>Kids Camp</strong></a> on her blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “After the first Kids Camp, we had several people in the local Zimbabwean WordPress community who were enthusiastic about encouraging young people to embrace ICT. In 2019, we had not planned to have a Kids Camp because of financial constraints but to our surprise, we had some anonymous donations and we managed to have a WordPress Community outreach to a youth centre, <a href=\"https://cttzim.org/\"><strong>Centre for Total Transformation</strong></a>, a week after our WordCamp. It is a non-formal school that caters for underprivileged and vulnerable children. The group were able to share practical skills about using WordPress, computer hardware and software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thelma shares that she became hooked on WordPress because of its community. “I enjoy attending WordCamps, meeting new people and just learning new stuff. I have a huge list of WordCamps I would like to attend. Last year I managed to cross WordCamp Johannesburg off my list. When everything is back to normal my plan to travel to WordCamps will proceed (fingers crossed).”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reaping the fruits of ongoing learning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thelma is committed to ongoing development training. She said: “Even though I can still cook up code in C and Java, for now, I have also included WordPress PHP functions to the mix. It was not easy to get to this point, daring myself got me to this slightly better stage. I try to do my best where I can and I am happy to say it has paid off so far.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thelma has continued her journey working in design and digital marketing last year with Trust Nhokovenzo who works in digital marketing and is active in&nbsp; the WordPress Community. He came across her name as a developer from talking with others involved in WordPress. She went to work with his team at a marketing agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her interest in the development of WordPress continued and she joined the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 Release Squad</a> in the mid 2020.&nbsp;At the end of 2020, she moved to become a Happiness Engineer working with WordPress.com. Thelma’s fascination with the platform and the community continues to grow and her contributor story is ongoing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out more about the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Harare-WordPress-Meetup\">Harare WordPress community</a> in Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>) and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sthakor</a>), Yvette Sonneveld (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>yvettesonneveld</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>chanthaboune</a>), and Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>).

With a brand-new default theme as your canvas, it supports an ever-growing collection of blocks as your brushes. Paint with words. Pictures. Sound. Or rich embedded media.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"234\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-1.jpeg?resize=632%2C234&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"colored circles\" class=\"wp-image-9346\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C379&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C111&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C284&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-1.jpeg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Greater layout flexibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring your stories to life with more tools that let you edit your layout with or without code. Single column blocks, designs using mixed widths and columns, full-width headers, and gradients in your cover block—make small changes or big statements with equal ease!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More block patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In some themes, preconfigured block patterns make setting up standard pages on your site a breeze. Let the power of patterns streamline your workflow and save you clicks. Plus, share these features with clients, editors, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better video captioning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you add subtitles or captions to your videos, you can now upload them within your post or page. This makes it easier than ever to make your videos accessible for anyone who needs or prefers to use subtitles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-2.jpeg?resize=632%2C120&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"black vertical line\" class=\"wp-image-9347\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C194&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C57&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C146&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-2.jpeg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Twenty Twenty-One is here!</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"714\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?resize=632%2C714&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Examples of block patterns available in Twenty Twenty-One.\" class=\"wp-image-9426\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?resize=907%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 907w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?resize=266%2C300&amp;ssl=1 266w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?resize=768%2C867&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?resize=1360%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1360w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?resize=1814%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1814w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?w=1975&amp;ssl=1 1975w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/TT1-Screenshots-Compressed.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-One is a blank canvas for your ideas, and the block editor is the best brush. It is built for the block editor and packed with brand-new block patterns you can only get in the default themes. Try different layouts in a matter of seconds, and let the theme’s eye-catching, yet timeless design make your work shine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, this default theme puts accessibility at the heart of your website. It conforms to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/\">WordPress accessibility-ready guidelines</a> and addresses several more specialized standards from the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at level AAA</a>. It will help you meet the highest level of international accessibility standards when you create accessible content and choose plugins which are accessible too!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A rainbow of soft pastels</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/Rainbow-Compressed.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"167\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/Rainbow-Compressed.png?resize=632%2C167&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A mobile screenshot of each included color palette in Twenty Twenty-One, going in ROYGBIV order.\" class=\"wp-image-9424\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/Rainbow-Compressed.png?resize=1024%2C270&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/Rainbow-Compressed.png?resize=300%2C79&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/Rainbow-Compressed.png?resize=768%2C202&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/Rainbow-Compressed.png?resize=1536%2C405&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/Rainbow-Compressed.png?resize=2048%2C540&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/Rainbow-Compressed.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/Rainbow-Compressed.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect for a new year, Twenty Twenty-One gives you a range of pre-selected color palettes in pastel, all of which conform to AAA standards for contrast. You can also choose your own background color for the theme, and the theme chooses accessibility-conscious text colors for you — automatically!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need more flexibility than that? You can also choose your own color palette from the color picker.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"151\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-3.jpeg?resize=632%2C151&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"colored circles\" class=\"wp-image-9351\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C245&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C72&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C183&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress5-6-3.jpeg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improvements for everyone</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Expanding auto-updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, only developers have been able to update WordPress automatically. But now you have that option, right in your dashboard. If this is your first site, you have auto-updates ready to go, right now! Upgrading an existing site? No problem! Everything is the same as it was before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accessibility Statement&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not an expert, you can start letting others know about your site’s commitment to accessibility! The new <a href=\"https://github.com/10degrees/accessibility-statement-plugin\">feature plugin</a> includes template copy for you to edit and publish, and it’s written to support different contexts and jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Built-in Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve not had the chance to play with block patterns yet, all default themes now feature a range of block patterns that let you master complex layouts with minimal effort. Customize the patterns to your liking with the copy, images, and colors that fit your story or brand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress-5-6-4.jpeg?resize=632%2C185&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"colored and textured rectangles\" class=\"wp-image-9352\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress-5-6-4.jpeg?resize=1024%2C300&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress-5-6-4.jpeg?resize=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress-5-6-4.jpeg?resize=768%2C225&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/12/WordPress-5-6-4.jpeg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>REST API authentication with Application Passwords</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the API’s new Application Passwords authorization feature, third-party apps can connect to your site seamlessly and securely. This new REST API feature lets you see what apps are connecting to your site and control what they do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More PHP 8 support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>5.6 marks the first steps toward WordPress Core support for PHP 8. Now is a great time to start planning how your WordPress products, services, and sites can support the latest PHP version.

thanks to all of the community volunteers who contribute in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a>. They answer questions from people across the world, whether they are using WordPress for the first time, or they’ve been around since the first release all the way back in 2003. These releases are as successful as they are because of their efforts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, thanks to all the community translators who helped make WordPress 5.6. available in 38 languages at the time of release. Our community translators are hard at work ensuring more languages are on their way (70 are already at 90%). If contributing to WordPress appeals to you, it’s easy to learn more.

These changes will only apply to new purchases.&nbsp;<strong>If you&rsquo;re on an existing active subscription plan, nothing changes for you.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The most radical change is coming to the Expert plan, which previously offered 1,000 sites for $199/year. The plan has been pared back to support 25 sites. Users who need support for 1,000 websites will need to purchase the Agency plan at $999/year, a 400% increase on the price for what was previously offered under the Expert plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor emphasized that customers with an existing active subscription will not be affected by the pricing changes. The company is also giving customers a chance to purchase the current Expert plan ($199/year for 1,000 sites) before it is discontinued before March 9, 2021. Existing customers on the Expert plan have the option to upgrade to the Agency plan at a 50% discount (valid from March 9, 2021 until June 9, 2021).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past 48 hours, Elementor&rsquo;s announcement has received 270 comments primarily from disgruntled customers. Some of them are opposed to the pricing hikes and others are unclear about what it means for their subscriptions long term. Elementor representatives&rsquo; responses to questions on renewal have been studiously unclear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One customer points out that the announcement does not explicitly say that existing subscriptions will retain the legacy pricing past the end of the billing period for this year. It does not state that existing active subscriptions will remain at the same price indefinitely, nor does it specify a term after which the pricing will go up. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor Evangelist Ben Pines, head of the company&rsquo;s web creator program, has left the question regarding renewals open, saying he &ldquo;cannot see into the future.&rdquo; Customers were left wondering whether the lack of clarity on the future of renewals is a foreshadowing of prices going up after the current billing year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;No one can predict the future, and offering a lifetime price guarantee is irresponsible for any future-facing company,&rdquo; Pines told the Tavern. &ldquo;What we can guarantee for sure is the extent to which we value user loyalty. This is why they have never experienced any price change in 4.5 years. We value our users&rsquo; trust, and have taken every step to ensure that our loyal users&rsquo; active subscriptions are not affected.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has not confirmed whether existing active subscriptions will be guaranteed the lower pricing forever and reserves the right to eliminate legacy pricing at any point in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the announcement, Pines said the pricing model for Elementor Pro has hardly changed since it was introduced in 2016 and that it is time to update it to best accommodate customers&rsquo; evolving needs. Elementor is now installed on more than 7 million websites and caters to a wide community of users with varying levels of expertise. The new plans have access to 24/7 live chat support and a handful of other benefits, but many customers participating in the comments said they do not require chat support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming pricing hike has heightened tensions for customers who feel the dramatic increase is unjustified for the software in its current state. They cited usability issues, persistent bugs, and performance problems that remain unfixed. Additional support features do not make the higher prices more compelling for this segment of the company&rsquo;s customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some who were disturbed by the radical price increase called for the company to consider creating a middle ground offering for the updated Expert tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I agree that 1,000 websites for $199 is low,&rdquo; one customer commented. &ldquo;Many small people will never create 1,000 websites. What bothers me is $199 for 25. Would it be more reasonable if it was $199 for 50, to have some middle ground? Or maybe you do not want the little people around any more.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A handful of customers commenting were unfazed, noting that anyone who builds 1,000 websites using Elementor and cannot afford $1 per work order should reconsider their business model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing changes can be a major source of friction for existing customers, as GitLab recently discovered when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gitlab-drops-bronze-starter-tier-in-pricing-update\">dropping its Bronze/Starter Tier</a> and imposing a 5x price increase on those features in a higher tier. Although the immediate impact of pricing increases will primarily hit new customers, it&rsquo;s the existing customers who have been paying for subscriptions for years who have the strongest opinions on the changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raising prices to introduce more value for customers or to account for the increased support burden is a natural evolution for companies that experience rapid growth over a short period of time. Getting existing customers to lock in their auto-renewals by offering legacy pricing is also a strategy for ensuring a more predictable financial future for the company. But Elementor&rsquo;s lack of clarity regarding term length for the discounted renewal pricing is the primary reason for all the agitation in the comments on the announcement.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 04:58:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: WP Feedback Rebrands To Atarim, Moves To a Full SaaS Model\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:179:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-feedback-rebrands-to-atarim-moves-to-a-full-saas-model?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-feedback-rebrands-to-atarim-moves-to-a-full-saas-model\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5872:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Earlier this week, WP Feedback founder Vito Peleg announced the company was <a href=\"https://atarim.io/blog/introducing-atarim/\">changing its brand to Atarim</a>. After 18 months since its launch, it would also be moving toward a complete Saas (Software as a Service) model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Feedback was created as a standalone plugin. The goal was to provide a visual feedback tool that agencies and developers could use to communicate with clients rather than spending time deciphering unclear emails, chat messages, and phone calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Starting as a freelancer and then an agency owner myself, it was always a huge pain to get clients to provide me with the content and design feedback I needed,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;And this led to us building a tool for us that worked extremely well with our workflow, which led to the decision to take this to the market.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, over time, the product evolved into something bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As we started gaining traction, I always kept a pulse on our users (now with over 5,000 freelancers and agencies), and it became clear that a standalone plugin, while it did do the trick, was simply not enough &mdash; especially for those that manage multiple websites and clients at the same time,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;It solved a huge part of the problem, but not the workflow in its entirety. There was a clear demand for us to build a centralized area to gather all feedback so we then created our Agency Dashboard &mdash; a cloud-based application that allowed our users to gather all the requests from different clients and websites to manage them in a single place.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peleg said the Agency Dashboard revealed a more complex problem in the industry. Agencies were patching together several different tools to provide various aspects of their services. These tools were leading to unnecessary friction and slowing down jobs, often adding weeks of additional time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team tackled more than they had initially bargained for. In 18 months, they added over 150 features to the WP Feedback platform. Peleg said the project has helped agencies and developers reduce between 50% and 80% of the previous time delivering projects and supporting clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the WP Feedback&rsquo;s users marked over 100,000 tasks as complete. Peleg calculates this has saved the industry over five years of unnecessary back and forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The name WP FeedBack continued to position us as what version 1.0 was &mdash; a basic visual feedback plugin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So along with version 2.0 that is releasing this week, I decided it&rsquo;s a great opportunity to revamp the whole experience with a rebrand, repositioning, and a whole bunch of new ways that users can use our software to improve their lives.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peleg said that nothing is really changing for existing customers other than having access to more tools. It should be a smooth transition for them. The goal now is to attract new customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I also hope that this transition will allow our industry to see the new reality we&rsquo;re creating for delivering website projects and why it&rsquo;s insane that a 5-6 days project still takes 6-8 weeks to complete,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the Service Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Atarim Agency Dashboard.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">There are two sides to Atarim. One is a client-interface plugin installed on each project website; the other is the Agency Dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The plugin&rsquo;s role is to provide a simple experience for clients to provide the content you need, approve the designs and request ongoing support,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;Allowing to visually click any part of the website (including in the wp-admin screens) and just leave a comment. The agency will get an automated screenshot, the screen size, browser version, and a button that will take them directly to the request, logged in, with one click.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancers or agencies work from within the Agency Dashboard. This serves as a central location for all of the work that happens around client websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, WP Feedback has already been a SaaS product with an accompanying plugin since launching its central dashboard early in the product&rsquo;s history. Version 2.0 completes the transition from a plugin to a full-on SaaS. Feedback and other data are no longer saved to the client websites. Instead, they are hosted via Atarim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Over time, we noticed that it created unwanted bloat to the websites that were using our tools extensively, so off-loading all the data and loading it from our side, was the natural route,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;But since this is how the platform was initially built, this was a massive undertaking that I&rsquo;m very happy that we finally completed.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The client-interface plugin is built for WordPress. However, the technology stack behind the new Atarim Agency Dashboard is on Laravel and React. The team thought it would be the best framework for speed and to work with as the company continues to scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been using WordPress myself for more than a decade &mdash; so it really comes naturally to me by now,&rdquo; said Peleg. &ldquo;The SaaS world is a different animal.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest challenges was transitioning everything we have built, to be pulled from the cloud as opposed to being stored locally on the client&rsquo;s site. The &lsquo;cloud migration&rsquo; project, as we called it internally, has been a year-long endeavor that, whilst it was developed constantly, was pushed back by our need to support our existing users, our growth, COVID-19, and all the other fires that happen when you&rsquo;re running a startup.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 21:54:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Pooja Derashri\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=9652\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/02/people-of-wordpress-pooja-derashri/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9544:\"<p><em>WordPress is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories that are lesser-known.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"331\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pic1.jpg?resize=632%2C331&ssl=1\" alt=\"Pooja standing in a banner \" />\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja Derashri shares the story of how she went from being an introvert from a small village in India to becoming a developer and working on international projects, thanks to the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As her interest grew, Pooja started following some WordPress-based groups on Facebook, where she first heard about conference-style WordPress events known as WordCamps. She later joined her first WordCamp in Ahmedabad, India. This three day event in 2017 opened up a new world—the WordPress community—and what would become a life changing moment. “WordCamp Ahmedabad has one of the best WordPress communities in India,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and everyone, including organizers and attendees were so humble and welcoming.”</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pooja600x600.jpg?w=500&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9654\" />\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The thirst for learning</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A fascination with how things worked and a desire never stop learning were traits that shone through in Pooja from a young age. She moved from Banera, a rural village in India, to a nearby city, where she lived with her uncle while completing her higher education. With her enthusiasm for learning, she decided to become an engineer. When thinking back on that time she says, “Being from a rural background, people in my village tended not to be keen on the idea of sending their girl child to another city for further studies. Fortunately, that was not the case for me because my parents were immensely supportive of me and my interests. They’ve always encouraged me to believe in myself and fulfill my dreams. With their support, I pursued my engineering in electronics and communication.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Discovering the opportunities in web development&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On completing her engineering training, Pooja was not sure what to do next. One of her friends suggested that she should explore web development. The idea intrigued her, and she sought out learning resources to study. She also secured an internship as a PHP Developer to give herself the chance to learn alongside professionals in the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Getting started with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p><strong>“I found WordPress surpassed other platforms. The vast knowledge base made it easy for me to learn.” &#8211; Pooja</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This internship led Pooja to her first job where she discovered a range of content management systems. Her view of the opportunities offered by these systems changed when the manager assigned her a small project using the WordPress platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recalls: “I found WordPress surpassed other platforms I had worked on earlier. The vast knowledge base made it easy for me to learn.” She soon became comfortable managing WordPress, working with plugins and themes, and wanted to learn it more in-depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja soon joined WPVibes as its first team member. Being part of a new startup gave her a lot of experience and a chance to be involved in new processes. As the company expanded they started providing custom plugin development services per the client’s requirement and created some free and paid plugins. Pooja said, &#8220;We found it very exciting and productive. Today, we are a team of 10.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Encouragement from the WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p><strong>Contributing to WordPress increases your knowledge</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At the event, she was able to listen to speakers from India and abroad, many of whom shared their journey with WordPress and how it had changed their lives. “One of the most inspiring sessions was by Rahul Bansal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He talked about contributing to WordPress and giving back to the community. He also explained how contributing to WordPress can help you to enhance your knowledge. It inspired me to contribute to WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community of Ahmedabad continued to inspire Pooja and her husband Anand Upadhyay, and they later started a Meetup group in their home city of Ajmer as part of their contribution to the community. They continue to be involved in supporting local users through the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/ajmer-wordpress-meetup/\">Ajmer Meetup</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KmA8iDgGrRar_cgD2jp2ThrzPxuzGTSI7SWkxDdHKyN4p2iNoj0e-VdOxO0xa1TtH56Uci9wEfYYfnW8DYji8c1HuaI7L-xhNqXyXt_kdchWtVxe_PnSea2knlWhP_O7qqG0Quju\" alt=\"Pooja with a WordCamp Ahmedabad badge\" width=\"500\" />\n\n\n\n<p>At the next WordCamp Pooja attended, she joined its contributor day, which brings users together to give back to the open source platform and global community. Most of the contributors she met were interested in giving time to the WordPress CMS. She decided to venture into a different path and took her first steps by joining the WordPress TV group, where you can explore videos from WordPress events across the world. She also discovered the joy of translating into her local language, and is a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglot</a> contributor for the Hindi language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, she was selected as a volunteer for WordCamp Asia in Bangkok, Thailand, and it became an impetus to become even more involved with the community. She was very excited about this role, and to be part of her first WordCamp outside India. Sadly, due to the global COVID pandemic, the event had to be cancelled. Her enthusiasm has not diminished and she is eagerly waiting to support in-person WordCamps in the future and meet even more members of the global community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her determination to be part of making WordPress and sharing skills has only increased, which has led to contribute to the WordPress Training team. This team manages lesson plans and prepares content to support people who are training others to use WordPress. The team recently joined a few other teams to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/introducing-learn-wordpress/\">launch Learn WordPress</a>, which brings learning materials together for users of all levels, and Pooja contributed to two different teams during the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Message to the WordPress Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja is eager to share her belief in the power for good in the WordPress community. “There is a huge community to help you with your learning, so start learning and try to give back to the community. It doesn’t matter if you are not comfortable with programming, there are many different ways in which you can contribute.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What I have learned in my life is that it doesn’t matter from where you came and what background you have. All that matters is your hard work and positive attitude towards life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more stories in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/heropress/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>) and Nalini Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>) for writing this story, and to Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\">@sthakor</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">@cbringmann</a>), Olga Glekler (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/oglekler/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>oglekler</a>), Christopher Churchill (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vimes1984/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>vimes1984</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>lmurillom</a>), and Yvette Sonneveld (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\">@yvettesonneveld</a>) for work on the series this month.

Edit or delete it, then start writing!&rdquo;</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January, <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/comparison/cm-drupal,cm-squarespace,cm-wix\">Squarespace overtook Drupal and Wix</a> to become the 4th most popular CMS with 2.5% market share, trailing Joomla (3.4%), Shopify (5.3%), and WordPress (64.3%). Although most open source CMS&rsquo;s are now in a gradual decline with proprietary competitors rising, WordPress remains a beacon of free software that continues to sustain its incredible growth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a time when some projects are abandoning open source principles when convenient for their business models, WordPress&rsquo; success has proven that an unwavering commitment to user freedoms does not have to be at odds with a thriving commercial ecosystem. These user freedoms are fiercely protected by the project&rsquo;s leadership and passionate community of contributors. As a result, WordPress&rsquo; GPL licensing now underpins a multi-billion dollar economy of services, hosting companies, and entrepreneurs who have built their livelihoods using WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every year I wonder when the project&rsquo;s growth might slow down, but end up refreshing W3Techs&rsquo; site obsessively for a week in anticipation of another major milestone, as WordPress hovered at 39.9%. Naysayers love to claim that hordes of people will stop using WordPress when major, ambitious changes are proposed. But if W3Techs&rsquo; growth tracking is any indication, new website creators and those climbing the ranks to the Alexa top 10 million have not yet gotten tired of being greeted by the message: <em>&ldquo;Hello world! Welcome to WordPress. This is your first post. Edit or delete it, then start writing!&rdquo;</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 04:38:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"WPTavern: GoDaddy Launches the Hub, a New Site, Project, and Client Management Experience for Web Professionals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111717\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:261:\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-the-hub-a-new-site-project-and-client-management-experience-for-web-professionals?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=godaddy-launches-the-hub-a-new-site-project-and-client-management-experience-for-web-professionals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5308:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Monday, GoDaddy officially <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/garage/what-is-new-godaddy-pro/\">launched the Hub by GoDaddy Pro</a>, a dashboard that brings together all of its products, pro-specific tools, and solutions. The experience is geared toward website developers and designers, creating a central location to manage their client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy Pro is not a new service by GoDaddy. The hosting company launched its <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/garage/introducing-the-godaddy-pro-beta/\">initial beta in 2015</a>. However, GoDaddy Pro is now offering a fresh experience powered by the Hub. According to Adam Warner, the Global Field Marketing Sr. Manager at GoDaddy, the Hub is being built in collaboration with real-world web designers and developers from their Customer Advisory Board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hub is at <a href=\"https://hub.godaddy.com\">hub.godaddy.com</a>. Existing GoDaddy Pro users can opt-in to the new Hub experience. However, they may continue using the legacy experience at <a href=\"https://pro.godaddy.com\">pro.godaddy.com</a>. They can also jump between both as needed. Eventually, the Hub will completely replace the legacy experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The Hub home screen.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;You can manage all your client projects, sites, and GoDaddy products from within the Hub,&rdquo; said Warner. &ldquo;Your clients&rsquo; WordPress sites don&rsquo;t have to be hosted at GoDaddy. The Hub works with all web hosts. You can run one-click WordPress updates, security checks, backups, and other bulk site maintenance work within the Hub. We&rsquo;ve seen users save an average of three hours per month, per site.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hub allows web developers to access their clients&rsquo; GoDaddy products without needing to pass around credentials. Developers can also send a pre-loaded shopping cart or purchase products on their clients&rsquo; behalf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This makes it easier, and faster, to get a new project up and running,&rdquo; said Warner. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about your client buying the wrong hosting plan or domain. Project management is integrated into the Hub, so you can keep track of client communications and ensure you&rsquo;re delivering projects on time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this journey began when GoDaddy acquired ManageWP and brought its team over in 2016. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-wordpress-site-management-service-managewp\">acquisition was anything but popular</a> at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We built the first version of our GoDaddy Pro site management tools on top of ManageWP Orion,&rdquo; said Warner. &ldquo;We added new GoDaddy-specific features, like allowing clients to grant delegated access to manage their GoDaddy products. We also included some premium addons for free on GoDaddy-hosted websites. Just like with ManageWP, sites managed in the Hub can be hosted anywhere, not just at GoDaddy.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hub has an interface that feels more Average Joe than tech savant. I half expected to see call-to-action buttons littering the screen, funneling users to every conceivable GoDaddy product, but none were found. Expectations from the GoDaddy of 10 years ago still linger and die hard. However, the company continues to move beyond its old reputation with its free tools and more recent willingness to give back to the open-source community, including its contribution to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/godaddy/\">Five for the Future</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Running a site security check.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;My goal in joining GoDaddy in 2018 was, and still is, to continue my participation in the WordPress and wider web designer and developer (WD&amp;D) communities in order to listen and return feedback internally on how we can best support freelancers in starting, growing, and streamlining their businesses,&rdquo; said Warner. &ldquo;GoDaddy Pro (the legacy tool) already existed when I joined GoDaddy, and my mission was to spread the word and offer suggested enhancements based on real-world conversations with freelancers and their specific needs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating clients, projects, and sites from within the interface is simple. Performance and security checks went well for the one site I have connected. The tests seemed to be spot on in comparison to other tools I have used.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Site performance check.\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy Pro membership is free. However, the Hub will have premium site <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/help/premium-site-maintenance-tools-in-the-hub-40384\">maintenance tools in the future</a>. Automated security checks, performance checks, backups, and uptime monitoring are currently free. There is no timetable on when they will be behind a paywall. Some of the premium features will have a downgraded free option when the switch is flipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While some adjacent programs (e.g. GoDaddy Reseller program, Pro subscription) may have associated costs or fees, GoDaddy Pro&rsquo;s integrated project management, site management, and client management tools are free,&rdquo; said Warner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commitment to offering the management tools for free is undoubtedly a good thing. Thus far, I like what I am seeing with the new Hub experience.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 22:31:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: Gatsby Launches New WordPress Integration, Expanding Support for Headless Architecture\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111778\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:235:\"https://wptavern.com/gatsby-launches-new-wordpress-integration-expanding-support-for-headless-architecture?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gatsby-launches-new-wordpress-integration-expanding-support-for-headless-architecture\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4035:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wordpress/\">Gatsby source WordPress plugin</a>, Gatsby Cloud&rsquo;s official WordPress integration, has been marked stable as of v4 and has been released to the public. The plugin sources data from WordPress for headless setups that use Gatsby on the frontend. It is a complete rewrite of Gatsby&rsquo;s previous source plugin and works in combination with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/\">WPGatsby</a>&nbsp;plugin to integrate content preview and incremental builds from Gatsby Cloud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After going into public beta last year, the new source plugin was updated to enable the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Users add a WPGraphQL-enabled endpoint to gain access to WordPress content in Gatsby&rsquo;s data layer for use in React templates</li><li>Optimizes links and images within the content HTML with gatsby-image and gatsby-link</li><li>Restricts image processing and optimization to images referenced in published content, so large media libraries don&rsquo;t slow down build times</li><li>Automatically enables access to data from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wpgraphql.com/extensions\">any WPGraphQL extension</a>, integrating the site with other WordPress plugins</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WPGraphQL is required as part of the setup. It turns any site into a GraphQL server, making the content easier to fetch. For the past 18 months, Gatsby has supported the development and maintenance of WPGraphQL to a stable 1.0 release. WP Engine recently hired its maintainer, Jason Bahl, to continue funding the project and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-invests-in-headless-wordpress-hires-wpgraphql-maintainer\">expand on its own headless WordPress initiatives</a>. This ensures that WPGraphQL will continue to have a strong future for use in decoupled projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;During the beta period, we were excited to see developer teams we admire adopt the Gatsby WordPress integration for their projects,&rdquo; Gatsby marketing manager Hashim Warren said. &ldquo;Teams from Facebook, Bluehost, and Apollo used Gatsby&rsquo;s WordPress integration to create accessible, scalable, and easy-to-update web experiences.&rdquo; All of these sites and more were using Gatsby + WPGraphQL in production before the new Gatsby Source WordPress plugin was officially stable, so it has been tested extensively during the beta period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rewritten plugin is better at bridging the gap to make Gatsby frontends less of a trade-off for developers who are working with editorial teams. It <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylbar/status/1359228717533302790\">improves build times</a> to be <a href=\"https://willit.build/details/type/blog/source/wordpress/page-count/4096\">under 10 seconds</a> for medium-sized sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complexity of editing and rebuilding Gatsby sites has been one of the chief deterrents for content creators adopting headless architecture. It imposes a more complicated workflow that the Gatsby Cloud product is designed to fix. This is how Gatsby monetizes its WordPress integration &ndash; by making the workflow more like what traditional WordPress provides out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recruiting potential headless customers, Gatsby emphasized the lower hosting costs of its stack. <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.com/pricing/\">Gatsby Cloud</a> is free for small, personal sites but limits users to 100 Real-Time Edits/month. In fact, all of the commercial plans have upper limits on the number of editors and how many times users can perform real-time edits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decoupled architecture still falls squarely within the realm of developers. Gatsby&rsquo;s Cloud product is one way that developers who choose Gatsby for the frontend can make their sites more user-friendly for editorial teams.

It is one of those plugins that suffers from the lack of block discoverability in WordPress at the moment. Like many other one-off blocks, you don&rsquo;t know you need it until you need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is essentially an embed block, but it is not specific to one website or service like Twitter and YouTube. Instead, it allows users to add a &ldquo;card&rdquo; for any URL in their content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mamadashvili has previously worked as a developer on several blocks for the Sorta Brilliant brand, which sported some of my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wacky-world-of-sorta-brilliants-sorta-fun-block-plugins\">favorite block-related plugins</a>, such as <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/emoji-conbini-and-the-case-for-a-block-enhancements-directory\">Emoji Conbini</a>. Unfortunately, those plugins are no longer in the WordPress directory at the request of the owner, Nick Hamze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Mamadashvili has continued building separately. Yesterday, he launched <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/toggles/\">Toggles</a>, a block for creating FAQs, hiding spoilers, and adding simple accordion elements..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have had his Bookmark Card block literally <em>bookmarked</em> for a few months, just now finally giving it the overdue trial run that it deserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The name of the plugin brings me back a few years. There was once a time when bookmarks were a common feature of the web. Entire sites were dedicated to managing them, and some people created their own bookmark pages on their WordPress sites. Some were mere blogrolls. Others were more advanced galleries with images. Even the &ldquo;link&rdquo; post format archive in WordPress has served as a bookmark system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of bookmarks is about preserving pieces of the web that interests us. So, I opened my dusty old recipe folder in Chrome and started putting together a recipes page for fun, hoping for some inspiration in my culinary pursuits.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Horizontal-style Bookmark Card blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy this recipe page a lot more than the plain links hidden away in my Google bookmarks. I suppose I could get even more creative and break everything down by category on different pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bookmark Card block currently ships with two styles. The horizontal style, shown above, places the image to the right of the card content. The default style, shown below, adds the image at the top. Users can also try combinations with other blocks for unique looks, such as adding cards to the Columns block.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Columns of Bookmark Card blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin can be useful in many contexts. Users can add URLs that are not supported via the regular embed blocks.  They may also enjoy the shared card style for all of their embedded links.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future Ideas for the Plugin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The simplicity of Bookmark Card is part of its allure. However, it is also overly simple in some respects. The only option it provides is the choice between a vertical and horizontal card style. This limits its potential, especially if the default design does not match the user&rsquo;s theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin does not need a plethora of options. However, it could use some basics. Text and background colors are a must. Base typography options, such as selecting the font size, would be nice-to-have features. Integration with the Gutenberg plugin&rsquo;s newer border-radius component would work well with this type of block. Like all blocks I test or use, I also ask that plugin developers add support for wide and full-width alignments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few additional styles or layout options would help. For example, a horizontal style that moves the image to the left of the card content would be a good option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin, which is currently at version 1.0, is a good starting point. However, it could be much better with just a handful of extras in future updates.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Feb 2021 22:50:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.7 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=9688\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/02/wordpress-5-7-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5026:\"<p>WordPress 5.7 Beta 2 is now available for testing! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f5e3.png\" alt=\"🗣\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so it’s not recommended to run this version on a production site.

The company has <a href=\"https://www.wpgraphql.com/2021/02/07/whats-next-for-wpgraphql/\">hired WPGraphQL creator and maintainer Jason Bahl</a> as part of this new team and will be investing in more engineers and other roles to support decoupled setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past 18 months, Gatsby has funded Bahl&rsquo;s time on WPGraphQL&rsquo;s maintenance and development. During that time, the project had <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases\">53 releases</a>, went from ~15,000 installs reported on Packagist.org to <a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/wp-graphql/wp-graphql\">more than 85,000</a>, and launched the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/\">plugin</a> on WordPress.org with more than 8,000 installs active today and a 5-star average rating. The community around the project is also growing and has contributed more than 30 plugins to the library of <a href=\"https://wpgraphql.com/extensions/\">WPGraphQL extensions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Gatsby&rsquo;s investment in WPGraphQL signaled that it wasn&rsquo;t just a hobby project, but was solving real problems for real users, and users should have confidence using it in their projects,&rdquo; Bahl said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Gatsby started transitioning Bahl to work more on other Gatsby integrations, such as Contentful and Shopify, it translated into less time to work on WordPress and WPGraphQL. This prompted him to seek out another employer where he could prioritize working on headless WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I feel right now is a unique time in history where more investment in WordPress as a headless CMS can change the future of WordPress,&rdquo; Bahl said. &ldquo;I believe WordPress is now more respected as a viable option for a headless CMS and that with the momentum of WPGraphQL, technologies like Gatsby, NextJS, and others, I need to spend&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;time focusing on WPGraphQL and headless WordPress, and not less time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bahl found WP Engine at the right time and will be focusing on maintaining WPGraphQL and working on wider headless WordPress initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be investing in headless WordPress, both in expanding our existing business as well as giving back to the community, as we have done for the past eleven years,&rdquo; WP Engine founder and CTO Jason Cohen said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re already seeing some customers moving to headless.&nbsp; While we don&rsquo;t see the majority of WordPress sites doing that anytime soon, we do want to invest in those who are.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, WP Engine is creating a <a href=\"https://github.com/wpengine/headless-framework\">Headless WordPress Framework</a> that is in the early stages of development. The framework uses WPGraphQL and provides a plugin, a set of npm packages, and guides for creating headless WordPress sites using <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;GraphQL as a protocol offers a lot of advantages over REST, which is why it is being used so much, even by players outside of WordPress, like Gatsby,&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;GraphQL includes type-safe schemas, is more discoverable, is easier to federate, and because it allows the clients so much flexibility in what data it wants (and does not want), it often results in fewer back-and-forth calls between client and server, while reducing the data being transferred to only that which the client actually needs. Because of the advantages of GraphQL, we believe a mature GraphQL API for WordPress will empower developers and site owners to move faster and with more confidence when they choose to go headless with WordPress.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bahl said WP Engine&rsquo;s investment in headless WordPress isn&rsquo;t limited to him continuing work on WPGraphQL. The company plans to hire more engineers for projects aimed at reducing the friction that developers and businesses experience when using WordPress as a headless CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe that WP Engine&rsquo;s investment in this space will allow WPGraphQL to grow and mature faster than ever before, as I will be part of a larger team working to make WordPress the best it can be,&rdquo; Bahl said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Feb 2021 23:22:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Rough Pixels Releases Empt Lite, a Block-Supported Freemium WordPress Theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111721\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:213:\"https://wptavern.com/rough-pixels-releases-empt-lite-a-block-supported-freemium-wordpress-theme?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rough-pixels-releases-empt-lite-a-block-supported-freemium-wordpress-theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6419:\"<img />Single post view.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Empt Lite, the latest theme by Rough Pixels, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/empt-lite/\">landed in the WordPress theme directory</a> today. Like most of the company&rsquo;s prior work, the design is on par with the best free themes currently available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have come to disregard that <em>icky</em> feeling whenever I see &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; attached to a theme name, at least when it falls under the Rough Pixels brand. The company does not deal in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/upsells-barriers-and-the-end-beginning-of-the-quality-free-themes-era\">stripped-down lite themes</a> I wrote about a couple of weeks ago. Empt Lite is one of those rare themes that does not downgrade the experience with the free version. Most additional features in the <a href=\"https://www.roughpixels.com/wordpress-themes/empt/\">pro version</a> seem to be value-adds for users who need something extra. There is almost an honesty to it. Users can get a feel for the theme quality before deciding to hand over money for the commercial version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some pro features probably do not make sense as an upsell in the long run. WordPress&rsquo;s upcoming Full Site Editing (FSE) could make them obsolete. For example, an option for customizing archive titles will be easy to accomplish in the site editor. An &ldquo;about me&rdquo; widget will not be a great upsell a year from now. However, custom patterns for an &ldquo;about me&rdquo; section might make more sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is assuming the theme developer goes down the block-based theme path in the months to come. Looking at theme releases in 2021 needs to be done with an eye toward how they might function in an FSE world. This includes what freemium-based theme companies are upselling. Some will likely need to change tactics in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one missing feature that I would like to see Rough Pixels include in this theme and others is custom block patterns. They are already covering all of their bases with block editor styles. Now that patterns have been in WordPress since version 5.5, it is time to keep building on the work already in place. This is also an opportunity to transition toward <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-system-will-create-more-commercial-opportunities-for-wordpress-theme-authors\">selling design-based upgrades</a>. Put together some custom pattern packages and see what type of feedback customers provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Theme Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In essence, Empt Lite is mostly a standard blogging theme. Where it shines is its support of the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Wide-aligned Cover block.\n\n\n\n<p>One of the surest signs of a theme author doing their due diligence with block styles is to test a full-aligned Cover block with text afterward. If the text butts against the Cover, the theme probably has numerous other issues. If there is spacing between the two, the theme author likely took the time to test almost all WordPress blocks in various scenarios. <em>I promise you this test works 90% of the time.</em> Empt Lite passed this test and my entire block-testing suite with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature that immediately caught my eye was the gallery-style blog layout. Rather than the typical top-aligned or masonry-type grids, the theme employs an offset style reminiscent of the Twenty Twenty-One theme&rsquo;s image and gallery patterns.  The effect is achieved by using varying featured image orientations, which the theme aligns to the middle. It is a break from the monotony of typical layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Offset, gallery-style layout.\n\n\n\n<p>This gallery style does require that every post have a featured image. Posts without them simply disappear from the blog and archive pages, but not completely. These posts leave empty gaps, throwing off the layout. Their titles appear when hovering over seemingly-random spots on the page. There is also an empty <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag in the source code. These are obviously bugs. If the theme author wants to support posts without featured images, the easiest solution would be to add a fallback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who love to customize their theme and make it their own will find enough theme options to whet their appetites. Whether it is colors and typography or post meta and the nine sidebars, the theme has settings to cover it.  Outside of the gallery blog layout, none of the customizer options seemed groundbreaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, I look forward to the day when theme authors do not have to build all of these options and relegate them to the site editor. Rough Pixels and others put so much custom code behind the customizer that it feels like a waste of development hours in the long term. FSE cannot get here soon enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme has a few noticeable issues, but they are relatively trivial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mouse cursor is set to &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; when hovering a post featured image, even when that image is not linked. <em>Yes, I unsuccessfully attempted to click a featured image multiple times, wondering why it was doing nothing.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wide-layout for single posts provides plenty of breathing room for custom layouts. However, the default font-size, set to 17px, is too small for comfortable long-form reading. There is an option to customize the size, but it applies to the text across the entire site and not just the post content on single views. Making it larger creates the opposite problem on non-single pages. When a project is billed as a blog theme, words-per-line matter. Nailing the typography is a must, even when it is on an alternative layout option. Outside of this one case, the theme gets the defaults right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The default quote style can make the text tough to read. The quote icon in the background bleeds too much into the foreground. I love the style; the color just needs to be dialed back while letting the text take center stage. The theme provides an option for changing the blockquote icon&rsquo;s color. I suggest tinkering with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Blockquote style.\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, this is one of the better themes to land in the WordPress theme directory in the past few months. Recreating the <a href=\"https://demos.roughpixels.com/empt-lite/\">theme&rsquo;s demo</a> requires almost no fuss. The typography is on-point for a blogging theme, and it works well with the block editor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Feb 2021 22:47:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Matt: Parse.ly &amp; Automattic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=53692\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://ma.tt/2021/02/parse-ly-automattic/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2030:\"<p>Excited to <a href=\"https://blog.parse.ly/post/9995/wpvip-acquisition/\">welcome Parse.ly</a> to the <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> family, in an acquisition that&#8217;s closing today.

While it includes several minor UI improvements, the biggest user-facing change is the inclusion of icon and background color options for the Social Links block. Theme authors can now add support for rounded image borders. They are also faced with a breaking change to their theme JSON files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-7-beta-1-is-ready-for-testing\">WordPress 5.7 Beta 1 </a>was released earlier this week. The final 5.7 release will include features from Gutenberg 9.9 back down to 9.3. Only bug fixes from upcoming plugin updates should be ported into WordPress during the rest of the development cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development team squashed over 30 bugs in the latest plugin update. It also includes several enhancements and API updates. Plugin developers can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/28482\">override the block category</a> when registering variations, which should help with discoverability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full Site Editing and other experimental work continued as usual. One item that theme authors should keep an eye on is the initial groundwork for additional <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/28049\">border options</a>. The experimental feature for adding border colors, styles, and widths for blocks has long been on the wish list of many. I expect that the team will start slowly rolling out block support and a UI in coming versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Color Options for Social Links</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Icon and background colors for Social Links.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21605\">change the icon color and background</a> in the Social Links block. This change allows the user to customize the colors for all icons in the links list. The &ldquo;logos only&rdquo; block style does not support a background color.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The missing piece is the ability to set individual icon colors and their hover colors. One of the use cases in theme design is to provide a solid-colored group of icons that change to the brand colors on hover or focus. The only way to do this from the user&rsquo;s end is via individual icon color options. Even the ability to set the icon hover color for the entire block is still unavailable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Branding guidelines were <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21605#issuecomment-629318653\">mentioned as a concern</a> with the current color options, but that concern is outside the scope of WordPress&rsquo;s responsibility (see <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/21900#issuecomment-624307120\">longer analysis regarding logos</a>). Many brands also have alternate colors they allow, which are not possible to use without icon-specific colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting the background and text color for all icons at once is a step in the right direction, but the block editor is still not matching what theme authors are doing in traditional theme design. These missing features are blockers for the eventual adoption of Full Site Editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rounded Border Support for Themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Border radius setting for the Image block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Theme authors can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/27667\">opt into border-radius support</a> for images. Support comes in two forms. One is a setting to allow end-users to customize the border-radius via the block options sidebar. The second is setting a default border-radius value for all images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg team first added border-radius support to the Group block in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-9-8-brings-rounded-borders-to-the-group-block-and-moves-the-site-editor-canvas-into-an-inline-frame\">version 9.8</a>. Currently, only the Group and Image blocks support the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following theme JSON code will add settings and styles support. Note the new format change, which is covered in the next section.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>{\n    \"settings\": {\n        \"core/image\": {\n            \"border\": {\n                \"customRadius\": true\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"styles\": {\n        \"core/image\": {\n            \"border\" : {\n                \"radius\": \"10px\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Theme JSON File Format</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 9.9 introduces two breaking changes to the <code>experimental-theme.json</code> file, which will eventually be renamed to <code>theme.json</code> once it is out of the experimental stage. This file allows theme authors to configure custom styles and settings for the block system. Any themes currently using the pre-9.9 format will need to be updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first change makes <code>settings</code> and <code>styles</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/28110\">top-level keys in the file</a>. The second change <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/28533\">renames and splits</a> the <code>global</code> key to <code>defaults</code> and <code>root</code>. <code>defaults</code> deal with default values and styles while <code>root</code> handles the site root block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ari Stathopoulos wrote a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/02/04/gutenberg-9-9-new-json-structure-for-theme-json-files/\">tutorial for theme authors</a> to update their themes on the Make Themes blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The rationale for this change is that the use cases for theme.json have grown beyond initially considered, and the vision is now being able to absorb a lot of things that themes declare at the moment via other means,&rdquo; wrote Andr&eacute;s Maneiro, the creator of both tickets. &ldquo;Some examples are registering (and translate?) custom templates, declare theme metadata that is currently stored in the stylesheet, declare stylesheet paths, etc.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also shared a vision of what the format might look like:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>{\n    \"name\": \"TwentyTwentyOne\",\n    \"description\": \"...\",\n    \"customTemplates\": ...,\n    \"textDomain\": ...,\n    \"version\": 1,\n    \"settings\": {\n            \"global\": { ... },\n            \"core/paragraph\": { ... }\n    },\n    \"styles\": {\n            \"global\": { ... },\n            \"core/paragraph\": { ... }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>For users, this data might not make much sense. However, any theme author should be able to recognize the significance of potentially moving metadata that is currently stored in their theme&rsquo;s <code>style.css</code> through a non-standard system that WordPress has used for ages. Eventually moving that data to a standard format, JSON, would give WordPress flexibility to shed some of its legacy baggage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress themes currently have a hard requirement of including a <code>style.css</code> file. We could well be on our way to building WordPress themes that have no need for a stylesheet at all. The future of FSE is likely one in which CSS is all handled through the Global Styles system with the theme&rsquo;s default values set via the <code>theme.json</code> file. If a theme has no styles, it does not make sense to hold onto the <code>style.css</code> file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this change is not merely limited to that possibility. The new format is cleaner and better prepared for future additions.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 Feb 2021 21:53:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Newspack Publishes Showcase with 60 Newsrooms Launched\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111568\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:173:\"https://wptavern.com/newspack-publishes-showcase-with-60-newsrooms-launched?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=newspack-publishes-showcase-with-60-newsrooms-launched\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4464:\"<p><a href=\"https://newspack.pub/\">Newspack</a>, a project funded by the Google News initiative and WordPress.com, has published a <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/collection/11158847\">showcase</a> of 60 news sites running on the platform. WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-secures-2-4-million-in-funding-from-google-and-partners-to-build-a-publishing-platform-for-news-organizations\">announced</a> its plans to build the Newspack CMS two years ago and successfully signed on more than 50 sites in the first year. The cloud-based platform is open source and highly customized to generate revenue for small to medium-sized publications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early adopters include the <a href=\"https://austinweeklynews.com/\">Austin Weekly News</a>, <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/\">Mississippi Today</a>, <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/\">Hong Kong Free Press</a>, <a href=\"https://oklahomawatch.org/\">Oklahoma Watch</a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://bangordailynews.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bangor Daily News</a>,&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://oaklandside.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Oaklandside</a>, and many other watchdog publications serving their communities with vital local news coverage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/collection/11158847\">showcase</a> was created using the Raindrop bookmark manager, which allows viewers to search for a specific site and see all the various homepages at a glance. The diversity of the publications is striking, but clicking through to their websites it&rsquo;s clear that most of them share an intimate connection with their communities that might otherwise have evaporated in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/finding-wordpress-in-the-post-print-news-era\">post-print news era</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Newspack stands out as an affordable, open source alternative to proprietary systems. Publishers generally pay <a href=\"https://newspack.pub/pricing/\">$500-$2,000/month</a> using a sliding scale based on their annual revenue. The <a href=\"https://newspack.pub/2019/08/12/see-the-revenue-generation-features-of-newspack-in-action/\">tools</a> they are given are open and designed to help create economically sustainable journalism. It&rsquo;s not surprising that a community has sprung up around the product, as small publishers share many of the same issues.  A dedicated Slack workspace. facilitates conversation and collaboration for more than 150 editors, designers, product and business people who are all using the same building blocks to run their publications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, thirteen Newspack publications were awarded <a href=\"https://newspack.pub/2020/05/07/newspack-publishers-earn-share-of-covid-19-relief-package/\">a total of more than $1 million in grants</a> from the Facebook Journalism Program&rsquo;s relief effort for local news due to Covid-19. Publishing online at a low cost on WordPress has helped many of these publications weather the pandemic, instead of being forced to consolidate or shutter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, 2020, analysts from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fundjournalism.org/\">News Revenue Hub</a> published a <a href=\"https://fundjournalism.org/2020/05/26/hub-report-several-sites-are-now-on-newspack-hows-that-going/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\">study</a> examining how Newspack-powered newsrooms are interacting with WordPress. A few key findings showed that Newspack users may require more assistance in managing their sites, which leverage the block editor and come with more than 50 pre-configured plugins:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The role of Newspack in reducing or replacing the need for website management-related technical resources is unclear, and depends greatly on an individual newsroom&rsquo;s technical knowledge and resources.</p><p>Potential improvements going forward should focus on providing deeper, more standardized education and documentation to broad groups of users.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The report concluded that &ldquo;Newspack has established itself as a valuable tool for newsrooms, as well as a valuable method for building sites collaboratively,&rdquo; but warns that the project may face challenges in scaling the hands-on support that pilot newsrooms received in the early stages. More revenue-generating features are still being developed but overall participating newsrooms had a high rate of satisfaction with the platform.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 Feb 2021 06:38:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: Call for Feedback on Theme Review Action, a New Automated WordPress Theme Testing Project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111325\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:241:\"https://wptavern.com/call-for-feedback-on-theme-review-action-a-new-automated-wordpress-theme-testing-project?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=call-for-feedback-on-theme-review-action-a-new-automated-wordpress-theme-testing-project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5176:\"<img />GitHub output of Theme Review Action.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Automation. It is one of those dreams in the minds of many reviewers from the Themes Team. If there was a tool to take care of 90% of the issues, the team could focus on the 10% not easily found by automated scripts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-review-action\">Theme Review Action</a> project. Steve Dufresne, a WordPress Meta team contributor, put out a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2021/02/01/call-for-feedback-automated-theme-testing/\">call for testing and feedback </a>of the new project on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If we could combine some of the existing code analysis tools, automate away some of the manual testing and open them up to more development workflows, could we improve theme quality, alleviate pressure on manual testing, and speed up the theme review process?&rdquo; asked Dufresne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project currently runs several test suites, including the current <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/\">Theme Check</a> plugin. Theme authors can run the texts by running the NPX command in their theme folder, adding it as an action on GitHub, or cloning and running it locally. Running via NPX is not currently supported on Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, theme authors are needed. Regardless of whether you are building themes for the directory, clients, third-party marketplaces, or a theme shop, this is an opportunity to give back to WordPress. It is also an opportunity to improve the tools that you could benefit from as a theme developer in the long term. Automated theme tests help the entire theme ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Theme authors need to be open to this and understand that it is not all about requirements,&rdquo; said Carolina Nymark, a Themes Team representative. &ldquo;It is about improving theme quality.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was, in part, informed by a Themes Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2020/04/03/proposal-github-theme-review/\">proposal in early 2020</a>. Denis &#381;oljom identified three problems the team was fighting against:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People don&rsquo;t like to read requirements or handbooks.</li><li>Some of the issues that are popping up are repetitive and could be caught automatically.</li><li>Reviewing themes in Trac is really cumbersome.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal&rsquo;s focus was on moving reviews to GitHub, focusing on the third point. However, the Theme Review Action project could be the start of handling one or more issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious solution is that the project can be automated. However, because the Theme Review Action project can be set as a GitHub Action, it leaves room for the team&rsquo;s GitHub review proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Two things I mentioned to Steve &mdash; and these are my opinions &ndash;, is that we need checks that run on theme upload and on live themes, and we need a long-term solution,&rdquo; said Nymark. &ldquo;There have been attempts to automate testing before that have not been followed through, and without a plan for how the tool will be used, I am worried about spending time on it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team had hoped that the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/theme-sniffer/\">Theme Sniffer</a> project would lead to more automation at one point. It is hard to get hopes up after previous goals never came to fruition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I too have a similar concern where the project might not get enough adoption to make it to .ORG checking, and that is one of the reasons (other than just being super busy) that I haven&rsquo;t been able to prioritize looking at [Theme Review Action],&rdquo; said Themes Team rep William Patton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the team and some theme authors still use the Theme Sniffer, the UI leaves a lot to be desired. Nymark pointed out that it was hard for theme authors to distinguish between the baseline requirements and recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;To display messages from automated tools that are not strictly requirements is very difficult to get right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For example, if a tool started reporting CSS linting errors for the WordPress CSS coding standards, many people would find that too opinionated and limiting.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors, the group that reaps the most financial and reputational benefits from the theme directory, have often been reluctant to chip in. Few companies spare an employee to perform reviews or work on tools that developers and the team need. Calls for testing, feedback, and discussion often go unanswered, leaving a select few to do the lion&rsquo;s share of the work. For this project to be successful and not feel like something foisted upon them down the road, theme developers need to be in the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-launches-wp-briefing-podcast-episodes-expected-every-2-weeks\">first episode</a> of the WP Briefing podcast, WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy talked about focusing on automation as one of this year&rsquo;s goals.

The report is a snapshot of data from December 2020, sourced from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/\">National Center for Education Statistics</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/\">IPEDS database</a>. After scanning a list of 4,000 active institutions,  EQAfy&rsquo;s headless browser was able to detect the CMS for 3,359 homepages (83.8%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A market leading group of 12 content management systems made up 90% of the homepages eQAfy detected, including four open source solutions and eight proprietary solutions. WordPress captures 40.8% of the market, followed by Drupal at 19.1%, as measured across all institution types (public, private for profit, and private non-profit), levels (2-year and 4-year), and sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&rsquo; estimated market share for public institutions came in at 27%, and is much higher in the private for-profit institutions category at 55%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at 2-year public higher education institutions by student population, WordPress falls to #3 at just 18.3%. Drupal leads the pack in that category with 29.2%, and proprietary CMS&rsquo;s take up the rest of the market. WordPress does much better in the category of 4-year private for-profit higher education institutions, capturing a staggering 75% of the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When examining CMS suppliers for institutions by size, WordPress is the overall market leader but does far better in the smallest institutional size categories, with waning dominance in the large to very large categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.eqafy.com/component/content/article/49-higher-education-research/315-us-university-and-college-content-management-systems-2021.html#table-10-2-year-private-non-profit-institutions\">report</a> has more interesting data comparisons across different categories if you want to dig deeper. It&rsquo;s important to note that eQAfy only collected the main websites for these institutions, which may not be representative of the CMS that powers the schools&rsquo; ancillary websites. They are often created using a combination of platforms. This report covers only which CMS the schools preferred to use for the face of their institutions.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Feb 2021 04:48:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: FSE and WordPress Themes: What Does the MVP Look Like?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111262\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:169:\"https://wptavern.com/fse-and-wordpress-themes-what-does-the-mvp-look-like?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fse-and-wordpress-themes-what-does-the-mvp-look-like\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8894:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy, the Executive Director of WordPress, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/02/01/full-site-editing-and-themes-where-things-are/\">posted a follow-up</a> to her <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2021/01/21/big-picture-goals-2021/\">outline of the upcoming year</a>. Questions mounted about what a minimum viable product (MVP) looked like for Full Site Editing (FSE), which is expected to be ready in the Gutenberg plugin in April. The core team is also shooting for a June launch of FSE in WordPress when it ships WordPress 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These seem like lofty goals, but members of the WordPress development and business community were left asking, &ldquo;What is an MVP for FSE?&rdquo; This is not a new question. Whether it is the swift pace of development, a communication breakdown, or so much of the project being hidden behind layer upon layer of GitHub issues, it can be hard to follow. There is no big webpage that spells out each step in minute detail of where the project is going. Information can sometimes feel scattered. This can give pause to third-party developers and business owners who need to know what to expect to update their products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joost de Valk, the CPO of Yoast, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2021/01/21/big-picture-goals-2021/#comment-4975\">voiced his frustration</a> with the process in the comments. We later discussed this in more detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think FSE will change what a theme is, and, if it gets executed properly, will make it far easier to build a theme, as themes will be much smaller,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That brings the burden onto the community to come up with reliable methods of styling though, and conventions on class names or similar, to make styling work everywhere. I currently don&rsquo;t understand what is even considered as MVP for Full Site Editing, nor do I see any discussions about how it&rsquo;ll work with themes not purpose built for it, and that worries me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He shares some of the same concerns as others in the community who feel like there is no process in place for an MVP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;And there is no such thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Vision without execution is just hallucination.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy said that she was aware of the interconnectedness. &ldquo;I also see that the information we have published isn&rsquo;t in a tidy and followable post that would help people make good decisions on behalf of 39% of the web,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She pointed to a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24551\">ticket that lists six (now seven) milestones</a>. Each of those milestones, when taken together, represent where FSE needs to be for an MVP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Together they outline an architecture that allows the expression of a full theme using blocks and an editor capable of customizing that theme,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;<strong>The MVP should make it possible to build a version of the Twenty Twenty-One theme, using only blocks, without any coding knowledge.</strong>&ldquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a breakdown of the milestones that need to reach completion before we see the first version of FSE land in WordPress:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Milestone 1: Infrastructure and UI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most crucial part of FSE is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24818\">workable site editor</a>. Merging the WordPress templating system into a cohesive UI is the foundation of the project. The underlying infrastructure handles how templates and template parts work. At this point, this foundation is in a reliable spot. It is all the features that build upon it that need more work. This milestone also includes getting the site-editing interface in place and handling multi-entity saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final leg of the milestone allows users to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27814\">edit templates</a> from within the post editor, effectively switching between content and design editing. The FSE Outreach Program recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-round-of-the-fse-outreach-program-concludes-identifies-template-editing-mode-problems\">tested this feature</a> to garner feedback after Gutenberg 9.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Milestone 2: Browsing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This milestone covers all of the work for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24552\">navigating the UI</a> of the site editor. There are many moving parts, such as switching between pages, templates, template parts, global styles, and more. Users must know which element they are working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the only milestone marked as completed. However, there is an open ticket for exploring the idea of a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23328\">&ldquo;browsing&rdquo; mode</a> alongside the edit and select modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Milestone 3: Styling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, this milestone centers on the upcoming Global Styles system. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/20331\">system creates a hierarchy</a> of how styles are applied to blocks from theme defaults to global user modifications, down to per-block style options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While much of the work is complete for an MVP, there are dozens of feature tickets in the backlog. This is also an area where the block system is years behind third-party page builders. Expect to see long-term feature additions based on post-launch feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Milestone 4: Theme Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors should keep a close eye on this ticket. The only way that block-based themes become a reality for most theme developers is if all <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22724\">template tags have a corresponding block</a> in the site editor. Or, at least if the most-used template tags do. Some of these functions are no longer applicable in the block editor. Theme developers should make sure they have the blocks they need to recreate anything they are building today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I am sad to see that blocks for Bookmarks/Links are unlikely to be moving forward. While the feature is deprecated, I am still nostalgic about the good ol&rsquo; blogroll days. Maybe this would be best left a plugin. A revival of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/link-manager/\">Link Manager</a> plugin could be in order.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Milestone 5: Query Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24762\">Query block</a> and its corresponding Loop block are, in some ways, the most essential pieces of Full Site Editing. They handle what posts are loaded and how they are displayed. The feature is one of the more complex puzzles to solve. The Gutenberg development team has continued iterating on it for months, and it is now at a good baseline. However, it has miles to go before it can seriously handle all the things that theme authors need to do with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the Query block only handles a handful of options for customizing the query. The team needs to determine what controls should be available in the sidebar for end-users and integrate the blocks with patterns for different types of post-list displays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Milestone 6: Navigation Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the Query block, Navigation is the only other block that requires <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27593\">its own milestone</a>. Navigation menu issues have plagued the WordPress project for well over a decade. It is one of the hardest things to get right. While nav menus in WordPress today are generally easy to work with, their design is not customizable by the end-user. The output is wholly at the theme author&rsquo;s discretion. Catering to the array of possible menu designs theme authors might want and making it customizable for the end-user is likely one of the toughest problems for the Gutenberg project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are at least a couple of dozen sub-tickets that need contributors. Even then, it could be several versions later before the Navigation block is ready for the more complex patterns used in some themes today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Milestone 7: Gradual Adoption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After the first six milestones representing the MVP are completed, WordPress needs a way to allow end-users and theme authors to gradually adopt FSE. Primarily, this would be a mix of block-based templates and traditional PHP-based templates. Developers should be allowed to update their themes without changing them wholesale, potentially leaving segments of their user base behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based widgets and navigation screens also fall under this milestone. Both features were punted to future releases after failing to land in 2020. However, these will be stepping stones for users who are not quite ready to switch to FSE or are unable to because of their theme.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Feb 2021 22:55:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.6.1 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=9574\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/02/wordpress-5-6-1-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8265:\"<p>WordPress 5.6.1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This maintenance release features&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=5.6.1&group=status&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=priority\">20 bug fixes</a> as well as&nbsp;7 issues fixed for the&nbsp;block&nbsp;editor.

This release will introduce <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&status=reopened&changetime=..02%2F03%2F2021&type=enhancement&type=feature+request&milestone=5.7&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=type&col=status&col=milestone&col=changetime&col=owner&col=priority&col=keywords&order=changetime\">68 new features and enhancements</a>, dozens of bug fixes, and versions 9.3 &ndash; 9.9 of the Gutenberg plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few of the highlights expected in 5.7 include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Lazy-load iframes</strong>: When WordPress 5.4 added lazy loading for images, contributors discussed extending this to iframes as well. Now that the&nbsp;<code>loading</code>&nbsp;attribute on&nbsp;<code>iframe</code>&nbsp;tags has been added to the HTML standard, it will be supported in core in 5.7. </li><li><strong>Streamlined migration from HTTP to HTTPS</strong>: WordPress can now detect if a user&rsquo;s hosting environment supports HTTPS and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-7-will-make-it-easier-to-migrate-from-http-to-https\">enables a one-click update process</a>, handling mixed content rewrites where possible. </li><li><strong>Standardize colors used in WP-Admin CSS to a single palette</strong>: WordPress is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/skinning-the-wordpress-admin-css-custom-properties-on-the-way\">implementing a CSS custom properties system</a> that will make it easier to add custom color schemes.</li><li><strong>Ongoing cleanup after update to jQuery 3.5.1</strong></li><li><strong>New Robots API</strong>: <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/49992\">This new API</a> allows developers to centrally manage the content of the&nbsp;<code>robots</code>&nbsp;meta tag injected into the page, and includes a setting to toggle whether search engines are allowed to display large media from the site. By default, a&nbsp;<code>max-image-preview:large</code>&nbsp;robots directive which will be injected into the&nbsp;<code>robots</code>&nbsp;meta tag based on the new setting.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These features need testing, along with the host of updates rolling over from the Gutenberg plugin. The editor is getting the most visible enhancements in 5.7, with features like dragging blocks and block patterns from the inserter into the canvas, major improvements to the buttons block, new social icons, and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official release is expected in just under five weeks on March 9, 2021. Testing is a critical part of the process for making WordPress better with each update. The easiest way to get in on that is to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (set to the&nbsp;<code>Bleeding edge</code>&nbsp;channel and the&nbsp;<code>Beta/RC Only</code>&nbsp;stream), or download and install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.7-beta1.zip\">zip</a> of the beta version.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Feb 2021 18:54:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: January 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=9632\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/02/the-month-in-wordpress-january-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11649:\"<p>For WordPress, 2021 started on a high note.

The proposal is aimed at locations that have more effectively contained COVID-19 (such as New Zealand and Taiwan, for instance) so that local meetup groups in these areas can organize safe, in-person events. According to the proposal, in-person meetup organizers should review local/global health instructions based on resources and complete a checklist — which recommends whether to organize an event or not based on the organizer’s inputs and other factors. Compulsory safety precautions should be taken for any in-person meetup, and participants/organizers can share event feedback with WordCamp Central. The proposal is still being discussed, so if you have any thoughts, please<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/01/26/proposal-update-decision-making-checklist-for-safe-in-person-meetups/\"> share them in the comments</a>. <strong>Please note: WordPress meetups and WordCamps are still online at this time and will continue to remain online until further notice.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved with the Community team? <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Follow the Community blog</a>, or join them in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQC7RN\">#community-events</a> channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

Version 9.7 allows users to drag block patterns from the inserter right into a desired position within the editor. It also has a new block variations feature and several improvements to reusable blocks. Version 9.6 makes the spacer block semi-transparent, adds a variation icon to the block switcher, adds site editor content to an iframe, and stabilizes Full Site Editing (FSE) by removing the auto drafts feature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building Gutenberg?

And yet, when I reflect on what led me here, it simply comes down to the common threads that bind us together as a community: the desire to make meaningful connections, the ability to do amazing things together, and the very human comfort that comes with knowing that I belong here.</p>\n<h3>It starts here</h3>\n<p>Just before I made my way into this world, my parents immigrated from Taipei, Taiwan to San Diego, USA. Growing up, I held a level of pride in being first generation which warred against a long list of discomforts that, as a kid, I couldn’t fully comprehend. That unlike my school mates, I rarely saw my extended family. That my English didn’t sound like that of my Californian friends, nor did my Mandarin mirror my Taiwanese cousins’. That cultural norms at friends’ homes were diametric experiences from my home.</p>\n<p>I realize that this sounds like I had a challenging, confusing childhood, but I assure you that I had a good time growing up. My folks are loving and made sure I had opportunities whenever possible. I always have had wonderful friends who generously share their lives and love my quirks. And, I have a brother who, despite being far smarter than I will ever be, still puts up with my big sister act.</p>\n<p>My point is that, it was painfully clear to me where I couldn’t fit in. Like many third culture kids, my perplexing cultural foundation had a profound impact on my values, and created importance around the concept of belonging, something I still hold to this day, and which pushed me along my way to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>The twisty road</h3>\n<p>I was terrible at college. I had no sense of what I wanted to do with my life, and drifted from major to major until I found myself entirely broke and rudderless. It was 2010, and with minimal job experience and 45 credits short of a degree, I desperately applied for jobs, taking the first that offered me a full time position.</p>\n<p>It was a pivotal moment in my life. The job gave me purpose, and I actually felt like I was good at something for a change. I worked closely with my boss and mentor, a highly regarded commercial real estate advisor with a warm heart and penchant for dad jokes. What set him apart was his belief in community values: the importance of education, humility, empathy, good stewardship, qualities that made him a respected leader in many circles. Over the ensuing years, I would finish my degree. But the lessons that meant the most were learned by following my mentor’s example, and would later translate well to open source leadership.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I began volunteering with renewed passion: sorting clothes at homeless shelters, working on literacy programs, teaching English at the library, serving meals, maintaining trails, building homes. I fund raised and coordinated volunteer events. Eventually, I joined advisory boards and committees of a few nonprofits, and became enamored of the strategic, thoughtful work that came with these roles.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HfH-Nicaragua.jpg\"><img /></a>Building homes in Estelí, Nicaragua. One of my favorite volunteer memories!\n<p>Ideas around positive change and impact through community initiatives blossomed in my mind. Driven by strongly held values, I continued to help and was welcomed at every turn. I learned that it was people who could create spaces in which anyone, everyone could belong and add value by virtue of being a unique, enthusiastic human being. I wanted to create these spaces.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>Now, it is a true story that I also found my way to WordPress through my partner, and that WordPress brought us together. We met through a mutual friend, and when I realized that he could build me a website, I asked him to do so for work. Arguably, one of my first experiences with WordPress could be described either as sharing what my site required with my developer, or innocently flirting with my future partner. The joke I like to tease him with is that I needed someone to maintain the site, so I married him.</p>\n<p>The other truth was that, after eight years of volunteering and lessons in leadership, my passion had turned to community building. I wanted a career in creating sustainable communities where people were openly welcomed, and members tangibly feel that they belong and experience joy in their participation.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, working with my WordPress site also reinforced my sense of belonging to something bigger. Despite not having any technical background (y’all, my degree is in English), I was able to not just publish with WordPress, but have a functional site that worked incredibly well for my purposes. I saw WordPress as a way for anyone to have a voice online, and as a result, I was also drawn to the idea of creating these tools that non-developers, like myself, could use in an increasingly online world.</p>\n<p>By that point, my WordPress developer had become my fiancé, and he once again suggested a WordPress-based solution, this time for my career needs. Just before we married, he forwarded a job opportunity with Automattic as a sponsored community organizer within the WordPress open source project. It was a perfect match.</p>\n<p>And that is how, in 2018, after going through the standard Automattic interview process (another story that I’m happy to share with anyone interested) I found myself a community organizer for the WordPress Project.</p>\n<h3>Where do we go now?</h3>\n<p>I’ve only been in my current role for two and a half years, but during this time, my belief in the power of resilient communities has only grown, fortified by supporting meetup and WordCamp organizers, bolstered by working on diversity initiatives, and humbled by opportunities to serve teams as their lead, mentor, or member. I’ve met and worked with so many phenomenal community members, full of passion and creativity, and have loved every minute of what we do together.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WCUS-2019.jpg\"><img /></a>The WordCamp US 2019 team. I miss you all so much!\n<p>More than anything, what excites me the most is that we still have so much more we can achieve together.

Köppen showed that wasn’t the case. Instead, moderately cool summers are the culprit.</p><p>It begins when a summer never gets warm enough to melt the previous winter’s snow. The leftover ice base makes it easier for snow to accumulate the following winter, which increases the odds of snow sticking around in the following summer, which attracts even more accumulation the following winter. Perpetual snow reflects more of the sun’s rays, which exacerbates cooling, which brings more snowfall, and on and on.</p><p>You start with a thin layer of snow left over from a cool summer that no one pays much attention to, and after a few tens of thousands of years the entire earth is covered in miles-thick ice.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Fascinating! The blog goes on to apply the idea to that strong base, accumulating a bit at a time, to investing and business.

Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 5.7 Beta 1 in two ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Install/activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the&nbsp;<code>Bleeding edge</code>&nbsp;channel and the&nbsp;<code>Beta/RC Only</code> stream)</li><li>Direct download the beta version here (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.7-beta1.zip\">zip</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for final release is March 9, 2021. That’s just <strong>five weeks away</strong>, so your help is vital to making sure that the final release is as good as it can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s new? <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f914.png\" alt=\"🤔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Improvements in Core</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lazy-load iframes</strong><br />Now you can enable lazy-loading of iframes by adding the <code>loading=\"lazy\"</code> attribute to iframe tags on the front-end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Migrating from HTTP to HTTPS is streamlined</strong><br />Switching a WordPress site from HTTP to HTTPS has proven to be a pain for all involved. While on the surface, the Site Address and WordPress Address have to be updated, content with embedded HTTP URLs remains unchanged in the database. With this release, migrating a site to HTTPS is now a one-click interaction. URLs in the database are automatically replaced when the Site and WordPress Address are both using HTTPS.&nbsp; Also, Site Health now includes an HTTPS status check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Standardize colors used in WP-Admin CSS to a single palette</strong><br />This change collapses all colors used in the CSS to one of the available shades of blue, green, red, yellow, grey, black, and white. The palette makes it simpler than ever to build components your users can read, because half the range gives you great contrast with white type and a half with black, according to current accessibility guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ongoing cleanup after update to jQuery 3.5.1</strong><br />jQuery deprecations in WordPress Core and bundled themes show up a lot less often, and the notifications make more sense to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New Robots API</strong><br />The new Robots API allows the filter directives to be included in the ‘robots’ meta tag. Also, the directive <code>max-image-preview:large</code> is now included by default to allow large image previews to be displayed in search engines (unless the blog is marked as not being public).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Improvements in the Editor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Inserter drag and drop: Blocks and block patterns can now be dragged directly from the inserter into the post canvas.</li><li>Full height alignment: Blocks such as the Cover block now can have an option to expand to fill the entire viewport.</li><li>Block variations: The icon and description of a block variation is now shown in the block inspector, and a new dropdown in the block inspector lets you switch between block variations.</li><li>Reusable blocks: Several enhancements to the usability and stability of reusable blocks have been made, and reusable blocks are now saved at the same time that the post is saved.</li><li>Buttons block: The Buttons block now supports vertical alignments, and you can set the width of a button to a preset percentage.</li><li>Social Icons block: You can now change the size of the icons in the Social Icons block.</li><li>Font size in more places: You can now change the font size in the List and Code blocks.</li><li>Many many other enhancements and bug fixes.

It feels low-key enough that most would pass it over as a simple upgrade to keep up with the times. However, this feature can create ripples that spread and benefit the ecosystem in the years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kirsty Burgoine, a front-end developer at Human Made, announced the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/01/29/introducing-css-custom-properties/\">introduction of CSS custom properties</a> for the WordPress admin. The initial work landed in a ticket for <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/49999\">iterating on the admin color schemes</a>. The first stage reduced the color palette from 199 colors down to 99, creating a more reasonable list to work from.</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><a href=\"https://codepen.io/ryelle/full/WNGVEjw\">WordPress color palette</a> by Kelly Choyce-Dwan.\n\n\n\n<p>The second stage will look at how to implement a CSS custom properties system that makes sense. That means doing the dreaded work of <em>naming things</em>. The Core CSS team is currently looking for feedback on how to best handle property names going forward and are open to alternative implementation suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once custom properties are in place, the new system could open a world of possibilities in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thinking Ahead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">My hopes of having WordPress admin themes have lived and died on each piece of news around custom color schemes, imaginative mockups, and the general hype of projects that never lived up to their promise. I may well be getting my hopes up again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers have been able to register custom admin color schemes since WordPress 2.5, but it was never an ideal system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite plugins is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemes/\">Admin Color Schemes</a>, which is maintained by designers from the core WordPress team. It adds several schemes for users to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Cruise scheme from the Admin Color Schemes plugin.\n\n\n\n<p>Sass, which is used to generate the admin color schemes in core today, has simplified the process. However, third-party developers still need to make sure their custom schemes remain updated between WordPress versions. The system is not built to protect against future compatibility issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS custom properties change the game. With their widespread use and compatibility with modern browsers, custom admin theming &mdash; at least color scheming &mdash; is much more of a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have not been this excited about the possibility of something new since Tung Do released his <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/dp-dashboard-an-alternative-wordpress-admin-design\">short-lived DP Dashboard plugin</a> in 2013. Now, a few days shy of eight years since its initial beta testing phase, I once again have some hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Original beta design of the DP Dashboard plugin.\n\n\n\n<p>Given the little wisdom I have accumulated over the years, I now see that completely custom admin themes never led to the right path. I am happy we never went down it. Administration UIs need to work consistently for users and adapt to changes over time. Custom themes were a maintenance nightmare every time WordPress added a feature. However, a system built on CSS custom properties means that customizations do not break &mdash; or break far less often &mdash; as the software&rsquo;s UI evolves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the focus right now is on color schemes, nothing is stopping WordPress from moving onto other features in the future. It is possible to set up a global styles system for designers to skin the admin in all kinds of interesting ways without breaking anything. Minor options like the border-radius of buttons, font-family choices, or heading font-sizes would be easy to roll in over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the block system continues to replace parts of the WordPress admin, custom admin skins will be far easier to maintain. Because everything in the block system is built as a component, it better future-proofs against back-compatibility issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a long and winding path toward a feature-complete admin skinning system. However, it is not outside the realm of possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I look forward to the day when theme authors can easily roll out admin designs that match the front end. Perhaps integration with the block system&rsquo;s <code>theme.json</code> is a possibility. I would not mind seeing a separate admin theme directory in the future either. The use case may be too niche at this point, but it never hurts to keep the idea in the back of everyone&rsquo;s mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If nothing else, the move to custom properties lets the team clean up the admin CSS and makes it easier to add custom color schemes. That is a win for the WordPress project.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 22:16:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.7 Will Make It Easier to Migrate From HTTP to HTTPS\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111377\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:191:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-7-will-make-it-easier-to-migrate-from-http-to-https?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-7-will-make-it-easier-to-migrate-from-http-to-https\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2593:\"<p>The next major release of WordPress will make it much easier for users to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/50131\">migrate their sites from HTTP to HTTPS</a>. It introduces new capabilities to detect if the user&rsquo;s hosting environment has support for HTTPS and provides a one-click update process, handling mixed content rewrites where possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;A major pain point in WordPress has been the migration of a WordPress site from HTTP to HTTPS: While changing the Site Address and WordPress Address to use HTTPS is trivial, updating references to the old URLs in existing content is not,&rdquo; WordPress Core Committer Felix Arntz said in the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51437\">ticket</a> proposing the feature. &ldquo;It cannot be accomplished within core UI and requires use of more advanced tools, such as WP-CLI or plugins like Better Search Replace, which is a no-go for most users.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress 5.6, there is no clear guidance in the Site Health screen about how to migrate to HTTPS, even though it shows as an issue. The user would need to learn more about how to update it manually, starting with changing the site URLs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress 5.7, if HTTPS is supported, the Site Health Status screen will notify users and guide them with a new button that updates the site with a single click. It also migrates the site content on the fly to use HTTPS for URLs. Arntz recorded a video demo of the update:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This change also comes with new environment variables and filters that allow hosting providers to change the URLs linked in the HTTPS status check in Site Health, so they can more effectively manage it for their customers&rsquo; hosting options. This is similar to how hosts can modify URLs for updating the PHP version, which has had a positive impact on getting sites running on supported versions of PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the streamlined HTTP to HTTPS migration in 5.7 does not handle updating content in the database. Also, if a site&rsquo;s URLs are controlled by constants, the update is not possible to complete automatically. In these instances, the HTTPS status check on the Site Health screen will inform the user why the site would need to be manually updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More technical details are available in the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51437\">ticket</a> and<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/50131\"> commit message</a>, and a dev note should be forthcoming.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:08:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: Block Manager Redesign Coming Soon\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111349\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:133:\"https://wptavern.com/block-manager-redesign-coming-soon?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=block-manager-redesign-coming-soon\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4379:\"<p>WordPress&rsquo; block management interface was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-5-3-introduces-block-management-adds-nesting-to-the-cover-block\">introduced in Gutenberg 5.3</a>, released in March 2019, and is due for an update. In case you haven&rsquo;t explored the editor&rsquo;s Tools menu, the block manager setting allows you to select which blocks will be shown or hidden in the block inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, Automattic engineer Nik Tsekouras opened a new issue in the Gutenberg repository for tracking <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28572\">block manager enhancements</a>. A few planned enhancements are already on deck, including moving the block manager into the Preferences Modal, redesigning it to use panels, and adding support for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27708\">toggling block variations</a> on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/28329\">updated Preferences Modal</a> is expected in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/milestone/141\">Gutenberg 9.9</a>&nbsp;milestone, which will be included in WordPress 5.7. (Gutenberg versions 9.3 &ndash; 9.9 will be rolled into the release.) Moving the block manager into its future home inside the Preferences modal will be completed in a follow-up PR, since it needs to be refactored to use the panels design. Tsekouras shared a gif of the design plan for this update:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://cloudup.com/ccaOScZFCHe\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/AlD8gnb5Wn.gif\" alt=\"Block manager update\" width=\"3002\" height=\"2288\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the discussion on the tracking issue, Birgit Pauli-Haack requested that the updated block manager also include information about how many times each particular block is used on the site. She <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28572?mc_cid=e944847429&mc_eid=68ffa9a210#issuecomment-770220305\">described</a> a common scenario where this feature could be helpful:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We recently took a site live were multiple team members collaborated designing the site and adding content, each aiming for the best outcome with blocks.</p><p>Some installed additional blocks from plugins to test and provide options or just do a proof of concept.</p><p>Before we took the site live, we noticed there are now 148 blocks available over 4 additional plugins + core.</p><p>We now have no way to find out which blocks were used over 40 pages and posts. I looked at a few Block managers plugins and none seems to be able to provide an answer to a fairly basic question:<br />Which blocks did we actually use throughout the site?</p><p>We would need the information to decide on which plugin can we safely uninstall.and which should we keep.</p><p>A revamp of Block managers could &ndash; and should- provide an answer.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />An example of instances displayed in the Find My Blocks plugin</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/find-my-blocks/\">Find My Blocks</a> plugin, created by Eddy Sims, offers a more advanced version of what Pauli-Haack is requesting. It has its own dedicated settings page for displaying a list of the block types in use on the site, along with the number of times each has been used, posts/pages where the blocks are in use, if it is a reusable block, a nested block, and much more information. Pauli-Haack suggests the block manager simply show the number of instances where the block is in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the block editor becomes more widely adopted, it is going to become imperative for users to be able to see, at a glance, the number of instances where a block is in use. Right now, even those who adopted the block editor right away haven&rsquo;t been using it for more than a few years. Long term, after years of adding blocks, people are going to need more information when managing them, and they may not know about utility plugins like Find My Blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussion is still open on the topic Pauli-Haack raised regarding block manager enhancements.

Chomphosy also said there would be no hot-takes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosephaHaden/status/1356277030921244672\">on Twitter</a>. &ldquo;Just bite-sized chunks about the WordPress OSS project and the how/why around what it does.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The show promises to be short. And, because it will only come around every fortnight, it gives people time to keep up to date at their leisure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;You can think of this as a sort of WordPress appreciation for any level &mdash; and honestly, all levels of WordPress awareness,&rdquo; said Chomphosy of the podcast&rsquo;s purpose. &ldquo;Bite-sized insights into what makes it all work. &ldquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy will be running the show every couple of weeks and plans to follow a specific format of three segments:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>An easy-to-digest overview of a cool WP philosophy.</li><li>A highlight of a community success story or a noteworthy contributor.</li><li>A small list of big things to know about (or do) in the coming weeks.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Guest speakers may join the show from time to time to cover specific topics when their expertise is warranted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common theme in the past few years, particularly as the pace of block development has quickened, is that many people find it hard to keep up with the project. Even those who are neck-deep in WordPress development can feel a little lost at times. A podcast built on the idea of keeping the community in the loop may even be a bit overdue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been on my list of needs since late 2017, but hasn&rsquo;t been my highest priority during that time,&rdquo; said Chomphosy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been years since WordPress has been small enough for any single, part-time contributor to keep track of what&rsquo;s next. Contributors across the project are doing excellent work to communicate efficiently about the work we&rsquo;re all focused on, but it never hurts to lend some clarification where possible.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/\">Seriously Simple Podcasting</a> plugin currently powers the podcast. The plugin is developed by Castos, which is a podcasting host and analytics service. It has over 20,000 active installs and a 4.8-star rating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy said they chose Seriously Simple Podcasting because the WP Briefing crew was already familiar with it. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to ask folks to learn an entirely new software while we&rsquo;re still working out the process.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first episode focused on an introduction to WP Briefing. The overview segment covered three trends in action from Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2020-wordpress-moves-toward-full-site-editing\">State of the Word 2020</a> address. Dave Loodts was this week&rsquo;s success story after sharing how he &ldquo;blindly&rdquo; chose a career in freelance web development and is still going strong after 15 years (<em>congrats, Dave!</em>). Chomphosy wrapped up the podcast with notes on Full Site Editing, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/learn-wordpress-platform-launches-with-free-courses-workshops-and-lesson-plans\">Learn WordPress</a>, and automation tools to help contributor teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is definitely worth a listen if you can spare a few minutes. I am excited to see where this project goes in the future and see how it helps keep more of the community in <em>the loop</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had one feature request, it would be for the development team to put the podcast player in the WordPress embed, which is easy enough to do with a custom embed template. This would let bloggers embed the show on their pages and share it with more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there may be ways to embed it via third-party services down the road. &ldquo;It just went live and we&rsquo;re working on getting it listed everywhere,&rdquo; said Automattician Marcus Kazmierczak in response to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gkurushin/status/1356273579273428995\">whether it would be on Google Podcasts or Spotify</a>. &ldquo;Hopefully it&rsquo;ll be showing up shortly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> the embed now includes the audio player:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/podcast/welcome-to-your-wp-briefing/\">Welcome to your WP Briefing</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 21:52:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Upsells, Barriers, and the End/Beginning of the Quality $free Themes Era\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:203:\"https://wptavern.com/upsells-barriers-and-the-end-beginning-of-the-quality-free-themes-era?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=upsells-barriers-and-the-end-beginning-of-the-quality-free-themes-era\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14535:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The WordPress.org theme directory is becoming little more than a crippleware distributor. I suppose it was inevitable given its reach, which can be worth $1,000s/month for theme authors.</p><cite>Justin Tadlock <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/1147472529113698311\">via Twitter</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">As I think back on that tweet from 2019, I realize how unfair it was to refer to the themes coming into the directory as &ldquo;crippleware.&rdquo; At the time, I was a part of the Themes Team (formerly the Theme Review Team). However, there were real cases of crippleware submitted to the directory when I wrote that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To define crippleware: some themes blocked core WordPress features and made them available via the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; versions. It was one of the more blatant abuses of the free themes directory I had seen for a profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the term does not represent the majority of themes submitted. Most of what we see today are &ldquo;lite&rdquo; themes. Some of them are well-designed themes that provide value to end-users at no cost. Others are stripped-down versions of what you would typically see from a starter theme. While they are fully functional &mdash; the Themes Team&rsquo;s rules have been strict on this requirement &mdash; the real value of the theme is in the upsell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the start of an anti-commercial theme rant. When WordPress developers and agencies are successful, it benefits the whole ecosystem. But, how do we balance that with providing value &mdash; which is subjective, I know &mdash; to the free theme directory? How do we transition the theme directory to something flowing with more artistic or even experimental ideas?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Guidelines and Stumbling Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Matt Mullenweg, WordPress co-founder and project lead, posted the following on the Post Status Slack <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1610310645240600\">two weeks ago</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The .org theme directory is particularly bad when you compare it to any half-decent commercial theme marketing page, or the designs available on other site building services or Themeforest directories. The .org theme directory rules and update mechanism have driven out creative contributions, it&rsquo;s largely crowded out by upsell motived contributions.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot to unpack in his statement. I agree with most of it. The Themes Team agrees with at least some of it. However, its members lack direct control over the system outside of the guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I actually agree with this in a sense,&rdquo; said Themes Team rep William Patton. &ldquo;Creativity has not prospered in the directory, and I think a large part of it is the barrier of entry. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do bad things&rsquo; is the overarching guideline for the theme directory, but that can be viewed very subjectively. If it were the only guideline we would see a lot of things that might not be best suited here. If we want to encourage creativity then more freedom to express it would likely be a good way to start bringing it back. However, it can be hard to know where the line should be placed.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team sometimes gets pulled in two different directions. When the project lead asks for things to be more open, many members rally around that idea. On the other hand, the call for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/why-accessibility-matters-for-wordpress-themes-and-their-users\">stricter accessibility requirements</a>, for example, are popular with others in the community. It is a choice between two ends of the spectrum that are tough to pull together as the gatekeepers to the official directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t it be more like the plugin directory?&rdquo; asked Mullenweg. &ldquo;That has all the same potential issues and has been working pretty well. I&rsquo;d like it to work just like the plugin directory, with direct access for authors, and most reviews being post-review vs. pre-review.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Team is not against the idea. More than anything, they just need the help to make any significant change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Having the themes directory work like the plugins directory would be great!&rdquo; said Themes Team rep Ari Stathopoulos. &ldquo;And, in fact, it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve all been asking for years, but there are many technical challenges because they are built fundamentally differently. Plugin authors have access to their plugin&rsquo;s SVN while themes don&rsquo;t. Theme reviews are public while plugin reviews are private and closed. There would need to be lots of changes in systems and meta. Not to mention that, as far as I know, plugins don&rsquo;t do post-reviews, they do pre-reviews the first time a plugin is uploaded and post-reviews for updates (which is exactly what happens in themes too).&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has created tickets, asked for help, and have generally awaited a champion to push innovative ideas &mdash; or any ideas &mdash; forward. <em><a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/215\">Seven-year-old ticket</a> to support the standard readme files available to plugins?</em> No takers as of yet. <em><a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5504\">Allowing block-based themes</a> to be uploaded?</em> Maybe we can make that happen sometime soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guidelines are likely less crippling than the outdated Trac review system, uploading ZIP files for updates (which Mullenweg mentioned), the limitation of a <code>style.css</code> header for the theme description, and the lackluster theme previewer.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Theme review system on Trac.\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, nearly every guideline has been put in place in hindsight. The team finds consistent abuse or issues and course-corrects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that Matt&rsquo;s idea of a creative theme is a theme that is not secure or not compatible with GPL,&rdquo; said team repo Carolina Nymark. &ldquo;Creativity is not limited by being asked to sanitize options. It is not limited by making sure that your theme can be translated. If the reviewers saw creative, beautiful themes that lacked in some other aspect like basic accessibility, then the team could help explain to the theme author what kind of changes are necessary. But that is not the kind of themes that are being submitted.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Financial Incentive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In the mid-2000s, the average theme developer could get away with building an entire theme on a lazy weekend afternoon. WordPress was far less complicated. Theme development was not a race to the bottom, bundling every feature imaginable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we live in the era of the multi-purpose theme. To soar to the top of the popular list, most themes need to handle everything from being the online face of a pizza restaurant to masonry grids for artist portfolios. They also either need good luck, name recognition, or good marketing. That is the reality for the average theme developers trying to make a name for themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes for boring themes in a free theme directory. If the theme author has any financial motivation behind creating a WordPress theme, they need to bundle the <em>nicer</em> features into a paid package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Eric Karkovack wrote in his piece for Speckyboy, <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/are-high-quality-free-wordpress-themes-a-thing-of-the-past/\">Are High-Quality Free WordPress Themes a Thing of the Past?</a>, &ldquo;Money changed the equation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is not much incentive to push a free theme out to the directory just for fun. Most themers are spending a month or more of their time in today&rsquo;s ecosystem to build a theme. The days of the weekend-afternoon project seem all but gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even releasing a theme to give back can often be a letdown. There is little chance of any name recognition as the developer&rsquo;s creation is swamped by the hordes of lite themes in control of the directory. There is no way for unknown players to get any exposure through the directory except in the brief moments their theme lands in the latest themes list. It is that one make-or-break moment that could potentially help best the algorithm and slip into the nearly unattainable popular list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison to Themeforest, the WordPress.org directory is lacking. Themeforest is inviting to users because it provides the backend tools for theme authors to market their themes. They can load up custom demos, provide screenshots, use a modern categorization system, and provide all sorts of extra data to end-users. They&rsquo;re in the business of selling a product to users. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />WordPress themes on ThemeForest\n\n\n\n<p>While WordPress.org may be free, it should still be selling the promise of a beautiful website to its users. I have always said it, the themes available on WordPress.org are the face of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users deserve better. Theme authors deserve better tools to make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with better tools and a better-designed directory in place, there is no guarantee of an uptick of creative contributions or a better overall balance that keeps pure upsells in check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think that due to the reach a theme or plugin that becomes popular quickly commands, monetization is a necessity to be able to properly &lsquo;support&rsquo; such an endeavor,&rdquo; said Joost de Valk, CPO of Yoast, in response to Mullenweg&rsquo;s statement on Post Stats. &ldquo;I think the community also &lsquo;demands&rsquo; a certain stability and a certain level of support that is simply unfeasible to expect from any non paid contributor. Because WordPress.org has no way of doing that monetization &lsquo;on platform,&rsquo; this is what you end up with.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also argued that something akin to an app store would make things like the &ldquo;balkanization from non-G-based site builders&rdquo; less attractive to theme authors. Such a store has little or no chance of becoming a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think we first need to agree on what the theme directory should be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We need a &lsquo;mission statement,&rsquo; of sorts. And I think we probably need less control than we currently have, be much more like the plugin directory. But if we have a vision of what it should be, then we could work towards that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an opportunity to turn things around. Full Site Editing will leave ample room for releasing creative, fully-featured themes with upsells. There is plenty of reason to be excited about pattern design and template packs, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-system-will-create-more-commercial-opportunities-for-wordpress-theme-authors\">better value-adds</a> for theme authors who want to upsell. The problem is going to be getting authors to abandon traditional themes and explore new terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Changes Are Coming, Maybe, Hopefully</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Popular listing on the WordPress theme directory.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For some, this is a song and dance they already know the lyrics and steps to. It is a years-long conversation that has netted little in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the WordPress.org theme directory may be forced to change one way or another. Block-based themes are not arriving in some distant future; they are knocking at the door. Full Site Editing is slated to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-roadmap-update-full-site-editing-targeted-for-5-8-release-in-june-2021\">land in WordPress 5.8</a> this June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this change, the WordPress.org theme directory needs to be prepared. Even with a move today, it will be a mad scramble to get systems ready in a handful of months. If waiting for the last minute, it is just asking for chaos. Block-based themes should already be <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5504\">allowed to be uploaded</a>, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we saw earlier this week, Automattic launched its <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-launches-the-blank-canvas-wordpress-theme-for-building-single-page-websites\">Blank Canvas</a> theme. It is designed to work on single-page websites. It does not support commenting out of the box, which is a requirement for inclusion into the official directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based themes will forever change the system. In the past, traditional themes needed to cover all their bases, integrating with every front-end feature of WordPress. In the future, that is not necessarily the case. Because everything will be built from blocks and users will have direct access to customize those blocks, a theme has no need to cover everything. The user can add and remove features at their leisure.  The review guidelines need to be molded for this future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full Site Editing almost seems purpose-built for outside-the-box theme designers. Whether it is a simple, one-page wedding invitation or an author&rsquo;s book landing page, there are more possibilities upcoming than there ever were in the past. And, these things will be far easier to build on the theme-design side of things. It will remove a lot of burden from developers and from the Themes Team during reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Regarding the FSE themes: to be honest all my hopes are there,&rdquo; said Stathopoulos. &ldquo;They are very different, and it&rsquo;s a fresh start for the repository. New theme paradigm, a different set of rules (with of course some overlap for basic things), and a new way of doing things and thinking about themes. However, if they are presented in the same way in the same repo we have now, then nothing will change. the theme repo <em>needs</em> to change, and there&rsquo;s no way around that. But that&rsquo;s a decision that will have to be made from the WordPress leadership and implemented by meta.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I remain optimistic about the future of WordPress themes, hoping for the ushering in of a new era. I get the sense that the Themes Team shares some of that enthusiasm, at least cautiously so. More than anything, they need the community, particularly theme authors, to chip in and shape that vision of what the WordPress theme directory should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps today, the stars are nearing alignment. Mullenweg plans to chat with the team and gather feedback in the coming weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:53:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: GitLab Drops Bronze/Starter Tier in Pricing Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111219\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"https://wptavern.com/gitlab-drops-bronze-starter-tier-in-pricing-update?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gitlab-drops-bronze-starter-tier-in-pricing-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5745:\"<p>This week GitLab <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/01/26/new-gitlab-product-subscription-model/\">announced</a> a pricing change that eliminates its Bronze/Starter tier in favor of a three-tier subscription model. The Starter tier, previously offered at $4/month, included features like single-team project management, next day business support, and 2,000 CI/CD minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />GitLab Pricing prior to Jan 26, 2021 Update\n\n\n\n<p>GitLab&rsquo;s updated <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/\">pricing</a> page shows the benefits that were included in the Starter plan are now only available in the Premium tier at a 5x price increase, introducing a larger gap between free accounts and paying customers. The change specifically impacts those who were happy to pay for a few extras but don&rsquo;t need the full array of premium features.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>GitLab is offering to transition customers at a discount, where existing customers have the option to renew at the current price for an additional year or upgrade to Premium at a discount. The company also makes a case for the free tier, which it says includes 89% of the features in Bronze/Starter, with 450 new features added last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Bronze/Starter tier does not meet the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hurdlerate.asp\">hurdle rate</a>&nbsp;that GitLab expects from a tier and is limiting us from investing to improve GitLab for all customers,&rdquo; GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij said. &ldquo;Ending availability of the Bronze/Starter tier will help us accelerate development on&nbsp;customers&rsquo; priority needs&nbsp;such as improving usability, availability, performance, and delivering enterprise-grade security and compliance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes sense that GitLab is turning its attention to factors like &ldquo;hurdle rate,&rdquo; as Sijbrandij told <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/gitlab-ceo-eyes-public-market-after-secondary-valued-it-at-6-billion-.html\">CNBC</a> that he&rsquo;s still looking to take the company public after a late 2020 employee share sale, which valued the company at $6 billion. GitLab passed $150 million in annual recurring revenue in 2020, but is tightening up its subscription model as the company tailors commercial offerings for those who need DevOps features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitLab did not share the pricing update announcement on Twitter, perhaps in anticipation of how controversial it would be. The company posted the link in the <a href=\"https://forum.gitlab.com/t/new-gitlab-product-subscription-model/45923\">GitLab forums</a> where customers expressed disappointment in the change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are currently paying Bronze level because there are some features that we find interesting,&rdquo; Riccardo Padovani said. He specifically referenced issue weights, iterations, multiple issue assignees, and issue dependencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;These features are now in the premium level. We were not interested in the previous &lsquo;silver&rsquo; level. On the long term, this is basically a 5 times price increase. Being a vocal supporter of GitLab in my company,&nbsp;<strong>I am not happy about this, at all</strong>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One customer said the change &ldquo;feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth,&rdquo; while another noted that GitLab&rsquo;s mid-tier offering costs just one dollar less than <a href=\"https://github.com/pricing\">GitHub&rsquo;s enterprise plan</a>. Many of GitLab&rsquo;s existing Starter tier customers have a large number of users who are not developers and do not have access to code or pipeline features. They are supporting staff who check bug reports or project management teams that create issues. Without the ability to pay per user role, upgrading every seat in the team to Premium doesn&rsquo;t make sense for these types of use cases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers who had recently convinced their organizations to go with GitLab, along with those who have invested time developing processes around the Starter tier features, are some of the most vocal opponents to the change. Some <a href=\"https://forum.gitlab.com/t/new-gitlab-product-subscription-model/45923/42\">found the announcement off-putting</a>, as it made it seem like paying Starter plan customers were actually costing GitLab money, requiring the tier to be eliminated. Many expressed that they only signed up for the tier to support GitLab and that they only used a handful of the features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that you say that &lsquo;many Bronze/Starter customers adopted Gitlab just for source code management,&rsquo; &ndash; yes &ndash; that&rsquo;s exactly what we use Gitlab for,&rdquo; one customer said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t use CI, Issue Tracking, or any other features offered even in the free version, but we do want to have a couple of the SCM features offered in the Bronze/Starter tier. Do you really think that customers like us that are only looking for SCM are going to pay more for unnecessary features?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GitLab employees in the thread seemed ready to defend the decision against the onslaught of criticism. While a few said they will take customers&rsquo; concerns and feedback under consideration, most were prepared to assure critics that the decision was made &ldquo;through extensive research,&rdquo; which likely leaves those most affected further alienated, if the 5x cost increase didn&rsquo;t already make the decision for them.

Around the world, community members organized 5 do_action hackathons (<a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2020/charity-hackathons-august-2020-report/\">4 of which were online</a>) and a handful of <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2020/open-source-workshops-november-2020-report/\">open-source workshops</a> last year. In moving these events online, community organizers not only brought their WordPress community closer together, but they were also able to make a positive impact on their local or regional community in an exceptionally-difficult year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing this impact, we would like to help more organizers host even more of these online charity hackathons (do_action events) and Introduction to Open Source workshops in 2021. This post shares more information for community organizers who would like to organize do_action events in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>do_action charity hackathons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on feedback from the community members, <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2020/charity-hackathons-august-2020-report/\">do_action events so far have been quite impactful</a> in how they bring participants together to help non-profits establish an online presence, something all the more significant in 2021. Here is how we plan to support do_action events in 2021:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Improving the online do_action event documentation: </strong>The community team is currently working on revamping the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/organising-an-online-do_action-event/\">documentation for online do_action events</a> to include tips on remote collaboration, using collaboration tools, remote project management etc. Additionally, we will be reaching out to past do_action organizers to share recaps and help share task lists to help organizers get used to the online event format.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sponsored accounts:</strong> Organizers can reserve and use <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/special-virtual-events-zoom-request/\">Community-sponsored Zoom Pro accounts</a> for their events.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Countrywide do_action events: </strong>There were <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2020/charity-hackathons-august-2020-report/\">a few countrywide do_action</a> events in 2020. More regional/countrywide events are encouraged.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Linking do_action events with WordCamps and mentoring: </strong>Since WordCamps are also online, organizers can organize do_action events in tandem with their online WordCamps, for more impact. Similarly, new do_action organizers will get mentoring from past organizers/mentors/community deputies.</li><li><strong>Technology changes: </strong>The following changes will be implemented on the doaction.org website in 2021 to support our organizers in a better way:&nbsp;<ul><li>doaction.org to Google Workspace / G Suite (so that organizers can use custom emails &#8211; get access to a branded Google Workspace account) &#8211; <em>Due March 2021</em></li><li>Doaction.org will be modified to support multiple event dates. &#8211; <em>Due June 2021</em></li><li>The do_action application will be moved to doaction.org.- <em>Due June 2021</em></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Does all of this sound exciting? If you would like to organize a do_action event in your locality, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/do_action-event-application/\">send in your application through this form</a>! Community deputies will get back to you shortly to take it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Introduction to Open-source workshops</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduction to Open Source workshops help spread knowledge and understanding of the open web and open source. They have also been instrumental in onboarding new contributors to WordPress. With the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> workshops on<a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/introduction-to-open-source/\"> Introduction to Open-source</a>, meetup groups could host a watch party of the recorded workshop or <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/12/08/tuesday-trainings-how-to-organize-a-successful-discussion-group/\">organize a discussion group</a>. Here’s how community members can organize open-source workshops in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Community members can now host <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/introduction-to-open-source/\">Introduction to Open-source workshop</a> discussion groups in the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/learn-wordpress-discussions/\">Learn WordPress meetup group</a>. If you would like to host a discussion group for a global audience, please <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/discussion-groups/\">apply to become a discussion group leader</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/wptrainingteam/what-is-open-source\">Lesson</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/wptrainingteam/what-you-can-do-with-wordpress\">plans</a> for the Introduction to Open-source workshops are available! Any meetup group can plan their open-source workshop based on the lesson plans.&nbsp;</li><li>Meetup groups worldwide are also encouraged to<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/organize-learn-wordpress-discussion-groups-for-your-wordpress-meetup/\"> organize an Introduction to WordPress watch party + discussion group</a> (based on the Learn WordPress workshop on <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/introduction-to-open-source/\">Introduction to Open-source</a>) as part of their meetup (it does not need any prior approval).&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers can feature these workshops and discussion groups in the WordPress Foundation blogs by <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/contact/\">reaching out to the community team</a>. Since open-source workshops are online, there is no cost involved in organizing them, but organizers can always <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/special-virtual-events-zoom-request/\">request paid zoom accounts for their event</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community has the power to uplift and empower people across the world by organizing these events. Our community organizers have already done stellar work in 2020, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. As we step into 2021, we look forward to supporting and seeing what organizers do with these online events to help their communities!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 12:55:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Hari Shanker\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"WPTavern: WP Lookout Lets WordPress Users Track and Receive Notifications for Their Preferred Plugins and Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=108062\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:269:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-lookout-lets-wordpress-users-track-and-receive-notifications-for-their-preferred-plugins-and-themes?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-lookout-lets-wordpress-users-track-and-receive-notifications-for-their-preferred-plugins-and-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8074:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><em>Should WordPress notify users of plugin ownership changes?</em> That was the question that Ian Atkins asked two months ago. WP Tavern readers seemed to think it was a good idea, at least those who commented on our <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/should-wordpress-notify-users-of-plugin-ownership-changes\">coverage of it</a>. However, the original <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5509\">Trac ticket</a> has not seen any movement since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are real technical issues with automating the process. A change of ownership does not necessarily equate to a change of the plugin author. This is often the case when someone acquires a company and maintains the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracking such changes does not necessarily need to go through WordPress. Chris Hardie built a service called <a href=\"https://wplookout.com/\">WP Lookout</a> that notifies users of such changes and much more. It has also been available since August of 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;WP Lookout watches for interesting changes to the WordPress themes and plugins that someone cares about,&rdquo; said Hardie. &ldquo;I created WP Lookout for professional WordPress developers, consultants, and site managers who want to stay more informed about the plugins and themes that they (and their clients) depend on.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While WP Lookout faces the same challenges with plugin ownership changes, it does have an advantage. It also <a href=\"https://wplookout.com/2020/12/tracking-mentions-in-wordpress-news/\">tracks WordPress news organizations</a>, including WP Tavern and <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a>. Even if the ownership change is not reflected on the plugin&rsquo;s WordPress.org page, the story may be picked up in the news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardie launched the news-tracking feature in early December 2020. It includes the <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/category/vulnerabilities/\">Wordfence vulnerabilities blog</a> and <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/category/wordpress-vulnerability-roundup/\">iThemes vulnerabilities roundup blog</a> as a part of the service&rsquo;s security notification system. The service also scans change logs for keywords related to security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notifications do not stop there. The WP Lookout tracks plugin, theme, and core WordPress updates. It also supports several commercial plugins such as Advanced Custom Fields Pro, Gravity Forms, and WP Rocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When we first decide to use a theme or plugin on a WordPress site, we hopefully research it thoroughly &mdash; code quality, ratings, support responsiveness, new release history, speed of security fixes, and so on &mdash; but once it&rsquo;s installed it&rsquo;s easy to neglect those important bits of &lsquo;health&rsquo; information over time,&rdquo; said Hardie. &ldquo;Auto-updates are great from many perspectives, but I think anyone who has had to manage and troubleshoot a non-trivial WordPress site over time knows that it&rsquo;s also important to stay aware of, for example, what&rsquo;s happening in the change log or whether ownership of a plugin has changed hands. But nobody wants to log in to wp-admin on a bunch of sites every week to gather that info.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardie said WP Lookout will always have a robust free option for people who just want a daily email notification for a handful of plugins and themes. However, there are paid tiers for customers to access more features. They allow users to track more plugins and themes and get immediate alerts through email, RSS, Slack, or custom webhooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The middle tier supports up to 50 themes/plugins, immediate email notifications, and a personalized RSS feed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Builder tier supports up to 200 themes/plugins and adds in Slack and custom webhook support along with the option to just get security-related notifications. With more real-world user feedback, we may adjust what&rsquo;s in each tier over time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All users get access to the Builder tier for a few weeks after signing up. After that, they must subscribe or stick with the free tier features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the Service Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Single plugin tracking history.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WP Lookout allows users to search for and add a tracker for individual plugins. The service primarily relies on the public WordPress.org API for getting plugin and theme data. This is the same system that WordPress uses to check to see if updates are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;But it also goes beyond what the API offers,&rdquo; said Hardie. &ldquo;For example, there&rsquo;s no standard yet for theme authors to provide .ORG theme change logs, and so that information doesn&rsquo;t show up when you go to update a theme in wp-admin; you&rsquo;d have to go poking around in Trac or source files to find it. So WP Lookout follows the trail to the change log details and <a href=\"https://wplookout.com/2020/08/wordpress-theme-changelog-details/\">puts that right in front of you</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Active plugin trackers.\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-lookout/\">WP Lookout plugin</a> available in the plugin directory. It uses an API key, which users can get from the WP Lookout website. The plugin then lets the WP Lookout service know what plugins and themes are installed and adds them as trackers. Using the plugin is far more efficient than manually adding individual plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For plugins and themes that are not on WordPress.org, the service uses custom update APIs provided by the third-party developers. If that is not sufficient, it uses webpage scraping. For news sources, it parses RSS feeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been interesting to see the wide variety of ways that WordPress theme and plugin authors do or don&rsquo;t manage and present data publicly about their products,&rdquo; said Hardie. &ldquo;Some have API endpoints that return the same level of detail as the .ORG API, others have change log/version documents generated by some internal tools, and still others don&rsquo;t bother doing much at all. I think an argument could be made to standardize on something here for the long-run to help boost the culture of keeping software updated, even/especially if it eventually makes the need for a tool like WP Lookout obsolete.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future of WP Lookout</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Hardie has no plans of sitting on what he has already built. One of the next goals is regularly adding new themes and plugins that are not on WordPress.org. This will mean connecting with development teams and figuring out how users can get notifications of things that often have no public APIs. The lack of standardization in the space could be a tough hurdle to jump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have a long list of features I&rsquo;m planning to add, including things like integrating tracking GitHub repo releases, bringing some helpful data points from WP Lookout into the wp-admin interface, WordPress Packagist integration, allowing per-tracker Slack channel configurations, better internationalization, and better handling of change logs that theme/plugin authors chose to maintain outside of their .org code repositories,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardie does not want to get too far ahead of himself with feature ideas. He said he is excited to get more feedback from users about what they find useful. Currently, there are 80 users, which is publicly available data. WP Lookout maintains an <a href=\"https://wplookout.com/open/\">open data and financial transparency page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Despite having paid options for more advanced users, I mostly think of this as a service I want to operate for the WordPress community, and I&rsquo;ll always have a robust set of free functionality,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also committed to participation in Five for the Future, bringing what I&rsquo;ve learned here back into improvements that might benefit all WordPress users, whether they take advantage of WP Lookout or not.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 21:56:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"WPTavern: ElasticPress.io Service Considers Next Move after Elasticsearch Abandons Open Source Licensing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110644\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:253:\"https://wptavern.com/elasticpress-io-service-considers-next-move-after-elasticsearch-abandons-open-source-licensing?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=elasticpress-io-service-considers-next-move-after-elasticsearch-abandons-open-source-licensing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6933:\"<p>Elastic, makers of the search and analytic engine&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch\" target=\"_blank\">Elasticsearch</a>, have re-licensed its core product so that it is no longer open source.

More than 6,000 sites are using the open source plugin, but the company said these users will not be affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;No matter what this won&rsquo;t affect the EP plugin,&rdquo; 10up vice president of engineering Taylor Lovett said. &ldquo;I would say the news is definitely discouraging and not a great look for Elastic.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10up <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/10up-unveils-elasticpress-io-elasticsearch-as-a-service-for-wordpress-sites\">launched</a> ElasticPress.io in 2017 and Lovett says it has become &ldquo;an active part of the business with a plethora of customers,&rdquo; and continues to grow. The company is currently seeking legal advice on how Elasticsearch&rsquo;s licensing change will affect the ElasticPress.io service. Since previous versions of Elasticsearch remain open source, the company has time to figure out a new way forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Right now we really don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; Lovett said. &ldquo;There is no rush for us to upgrade&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://elasticpress.io/\">ElasticPress.io</a>&nbsp;to Elasticsearch 7.11+ so we have plenty of time to decide how to address the issue.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lovett confirmed that 10up is considering using the Amazon fork as an option but has not  made a decision on the matter yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I will say this does affect the end user in a way that they may end up having to choose between different flavors of Elasticserarch,&rdquo; Lovett said.<br /><br />&ldquo;For example, you may need to decide if you want the official Elastic distribution or if you want to go with AWS&rsquo;s fork.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, for businesses that built services on top of redistributing the previously open source Elasticsearch, Elastic&rsquo;s creators have gone back on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200120104750/https:/www.elastic.co/what-is/open-x-pack\">the promise they made in 2018</a> to never change the license of any of the Apache 2.0 code of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash projects.&nbsp;As a consequence, Amazon has emerged as the one to drive the truly open source option for Elasticsearch and Kibana for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Elastic&rsquo;s relicensing is not evidence of any failure of the open source licensing model or a gap in open source licenses,&rdquo; the OSI board of directors stated in a recent <a href=\"https://opensource.org/node/1099\">post</a> on the matter. &ldquo;It is simply that Elastic&rsquo;s current business model is inconsistent with what open source licenses are designed to do. Its current business desires are what proprietary licenses (which includes source available) are designed for.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 20:25:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: Automattic Launches the Blank Canvas WordPress Theme for Building Single-Page Websites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110986\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:237:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-launches-the-blank-canvas-wordpress-theme-for-building-single-page-websites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=automattic-launches-the-blank-canvas-wordpress-theme-for-building-single-page-websites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7389:\"<img />Split Screen pattern from Blank Canvas.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Monday, Automattic <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/01/25/building-single-page-websites-on-wordpress-com/\">announced its Blank Canvas theme</a> on WordPress.com. The goal is to allow end-users to build single-page websites, such as an &ldquo;about me&rdquo; or product landing page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blank Canvas is a child theme of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/exploring-seedlet-automattics-block-first-wordpress-theme\">Seedlet</a>, which Automattic&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/about/\">Theme Team</a> has been using as a launchpad. One example is its recently-released <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-releases-spearhead-a-seedlet-child-theme-aimed-at-podcasters-and-content-creators\">Spearhead</a> child theme. It also provided the foundational work for the recent Twenty Twenty-One default WordPress theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One-page themes are nothing new. Theme builders have been releasing them for years in various forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working on block patterns a lot lately, and it became clear that many of the single-page websites we come across daily &mdash; collections of links, newsletter signups, etc. &mdash; are basically just simple block patterns sitting on an otherwise blank page,&rdquo; said Kjell Reigstad, the lead developer on the theme. &ldquo;That being the case, it seemed like WordPress should be able to power these sorts of single-page sites pretty easily. Blank Canvas is an attempt to try that out.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is not the ideal platform for the majority of one-page sites. Doing so includes setting up a database, installing the software, and keeping everything updated. The admin interface is not well-suited to those types of sites. WordPress is a content management system. One page is not enough content to need a full-blown CMS to manage. There simply is little upside for the average user to go through the hassle of doing this on even the cheapest of shared hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you have a network where someone else, such as WordPress.com, takes out all the hassle of maintaining the backend and when it does not cost you a dime, WordPress suddenly makes more sense. It becomes an ideal platform for these types of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankly, I do not know why they have not pushed this concept sooner. Jason Schuller has made a go of it with Leeflets in the past. Since then, he and Philip Kurth have taken that idea further and launched <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/landing-kit-for-wordpress-maps-any-post-or-page-to-a-custom-domain\">WP Landing Kit</a>, which builds on the same concept of creating multiple single-page landing sites from one WordPress installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some respects, Blank Canvas offers a glimpse into Full Site Editing. It is almost a stepping stone or a small yet limited preview of things to come. The theme puts the entire design process into a single page and a single editor. Eventually, this will be extended to the whole website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a great way to think about it,&rdquo; said Reigstad. &ldquo;Full Site Editing is coming soon, but in the meantime, Blank Canvas lets you do just a little bit more with Gutenberg than you could before.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>About the Theme</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The theme is called <strong>Blank</strong> Canvas for a reason. Its <a href=\"https://blankcanvasdemo.wordpress.com/\">demo page</a> is literally a blank screen with a footer message. The idea is that the end-user designs their homepage &mdash; or their entire site in the case of a single-page website &mdash; via the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who need a starting point, the theme comes packaged with six block patterns:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>About Me</li><li>Links</li><li>Invitation</li><li>Split Screen</li><li>Card</li><li>Email Signup</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Invitation block pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress users can install the theme too. It is currently awaiting review for the theme directory, but they can snag the ZIP file or SVN link from its <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/94482\">Trac ticket</a>. For those giving it a test, be sure to disable the title and tagline via the customizer so they do not appear on the front end. That is assuming you want to use the theme as intended. It will also work as a more traditional theme because the Seedlet parent theme covers all the necessary features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are differences between the theme on WordPress.com and that submitted to the WordPress.org theme directory. The .ORG version has only four block patterns. The .COM version includes an additional Card pattern, which integrates with Automattic&rsquo;s Layout Grid plugin. The Email Signup pattern needs Jetpack&rsquo;s form feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple conditional checks for Layout Grid or Jetpack before registering the patterns would suffice for users with those plugins installed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s planned,&rdquo; said Reigstad of adding the missing patterns, &ldquo;but we just didn&rsquo;t implement it yet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Email Signup block pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com users have something else to look forward to. In November, the service <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-drops-over-100-block-patterns-carving-a-path-the-design-community-should-follow\">launched over 100 patterns</a>. &ldquo;One of the nice things is that there are already a lot of patterns out there that seem ready-made for single-page websites,&rdquo; said Reigstad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He did say the team is working on bundling more patterns in the future. These may include more &ldquo;link in bio&rdquo; designs that expand on the one already in the theme today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pioneering Block-Friendly Themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Several of the ideas available in this theme seemed to have started from the WordPress <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments\">Theme Experiments repository</a>. It features block patterns similar in scope to the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/carrd-like-theme-experiment-provides-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-theming\">Carrd-like theme</a> Reigstad built last October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In general, building block-based themes helped redefine our idea of what a theme needed to be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d tended to think of a theme as a complicated piece of software that accounts for every scenario you throw at it: a blog, custom post types, category pages, search pages, the 404 page, etc.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reigstad said that the block-based themes paradigm has forced the Theme Team to start small. Because Full Site Editing is still in flux, its features not ready, the team has built proof-of-concept themes with limited functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The possibilities for block-based themes have grown considerably since then (as shown by TT1 Blocks, Q, Block-based Bosco, and others), but the early constraints helped spark ideas like that Carrd-inspired theme,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It turned out that you could build a pretty useful site with just a handful of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;That mindset definitely informed Blank Canvas &mdash; we started small, with just the functionality someone would need to build a single-page site. Since it&rsquo;s based on a full-featured theme (Seedlet), you can grow with it too.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 22:11:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"WPTavern: Plugin Team Draws a Line: Plugins Must Not Change WordPress’ Default Automatic Update Settings\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=111034\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:249:\"https://wptavern.com/plugin-team-draws-a-line-plugins-must-not-change-wordpress-default-automatic-update-settings?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=plugin-team-draws-a-line-plugins-must-not-change-wordpress-default-automatic-update-settings\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3110:\"<p>WordPress&rsquo; plugin team has published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2021/01/26/reminder-plugins-must-not-interfere-with-updates/\">statement</a> regarding plugins making changes to users&rsquo; update services: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Unless your&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;has the&nbsp;<em>purpose</em>&nbsp;of managing updates, you&nbsp;<strong>must not</strong>&nbsp;change the&nbsp;defaults&nbsp;of WordPress&rsquo; update settings.</p><p>You&nbsp;<em>may</em>&nbsp;offer a feature to auto-update, but it has to honor the&nbsp;core&nbsp;settings. This means if someone has set their site to &ldquo;Never update any of my plugins or themes&rdquo; you are not to change those for them unless they opt-in and request it.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement was prompted by plugins overstepping this boundary, which, up until recently, has simply been understood but not explicitly forbidden. Mika Epstein said the practice &ldquo;destroys the faith users have in you to not break their sites.&rdquo; It also reflects poorly on WordPress as a whole when plugin authors abuse core features to serve their own interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sadly, this happened recently to a well used plugin, and the fallout has been pretty bad,&rdquo; Epstein said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She did not identify the plugin in question, but one particular incident that happened last month bears a strong likeness to this description. On December 21, 2020, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/all-in-one-seo-plugin-turns-on-automatic-updates-without-notifying-users-removes-functionality-in-latest-release\">All in One SEO plugin turned on automatic updates without notifying its users</a>, aside from a short, ambiguous note in the changelog.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>All in One SEO was active on more than 2 million WordPress sites when it rolled out this update. Many users were frustrated to discover that their sites had been updated without permission, despite having auto updates turned off for the plugin. The plugin&rsquo;s developers removed the auto updates wrapper&nbsp;functionality from the plugin earlier this month, in favor of letting WordPress handle updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this incident, those who were affected were left with questions. Should WordPress allow this practice? Should plugin developers be required to place a notice in the dashboard if they are going to flip automatic updates on? While many users are willing to trust WordPress core to do automatic updates in a safe way, some are not willing to extend that trust to plugin developers, whose quality of updates vary widely. The plugin team offering guidance and communication on this matter was absolutely necessary to deter aggressive plugin developers from destroying what is still a fragile trust in automatic updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;At this time, we have no plans to spell this out in a guideline,&rdquo; Epstein said. &ldquo;We do currently, regularly flag plugins that go outside their dictated (self defined) boundaries, and this is not a change. Please, respect your users.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 20:43:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: Jetpack Launches Customer Research Project to Improve the Plugin and Reduce User Frustration\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110995\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:249:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-launches-customer-research-project-to-improve-the-plugin-and-reduce-user-frustration?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jetpack-launches-customer-research-project-to-improve-the-plugin-and-reduce-user-frustration\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6244:\"<p>Jetpack&rsquo;s Design and Research Team is <a href=\"https://automattic.design/2021/01/26/were-all-ears/\">launching a new customer research panel</a> as part of an ongoing effort to collect feedback in advance of launching new features. They are allocating one day every month to talk with users:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It&rsquo;s a small step toward an important goal of better understanding what our users need, seeing and hearing first hand where they are frustrated, and learning how Jetpack can work better for them.</p><p>The relationship benefits both sides. Our customers enjoy a sneak preview of features coming down the roadmap, and are empowered to help shape the product&rsquo;s future. And our design slash research team sees first hand, how our products perform with real folks using them.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack is recruiting customers for 45-minute long interviews on Zoom where they will preview some new designs and talk about proposed product improvements that are already in the works. In exchange, participants receive a $25 Amazon gift card.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This outreach effort may help in easing the periodic friction between Automattic and the larger WordPress community, which tends to emerge like pop-up storms on social media and quickly dissipate, but not without taxing onlookers&rsquo; good will. Although Jetpack is active on more than 5 million sites, and is marketed as &ldquo;the most popular WordPress plugin for just about everything,&rdquo; its team occasionally seems out of touch with users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One recent example of this happened when Matt Medeiros drew attention to the wording for the Jetpack Scan upsells that appear on the plugins page in the admin.  Specifically, people took issue with the claim that &ldquo;adding plugins can expose your site to security risks.&rdquo; While this is true, participants in the resulting heated discussion said it implies that Jetpack, the plugin that claims to do &ldquo;just about everything,&rdquo; is the only safe plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Everyone: WordPress is amazing because you can use plugins! <br />Jetpack: Careful, it\'s a scary place that WordPress repo is.<br />Everyone: Didn\'t you come from .org? <br />Jetpack: Just buy my protection plan. <a href=\"https://t.co/5oqbsroqSA\">pic.twitter.com/5oqbsroqSA</a></p>&mdash; I podcast a lot&#127897; (@mattmedeiros) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros/status/1352275821763948550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 21, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some perceived it to be in violation of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/#11-plugins-should-not-hijack-the-admin-dashboard\">#11 of the Plugin Directory guidelines</a>, which states that plugins should not hijack the admin dashboard. The guideline also recommends avoiding advertising in the admin &ldquo;as it is generally ineffective,&rdquo; as well as frustrating for users who are not looking for additional complications while solving problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular case was resolved after Automattic product designer Jeff Golenski took the community feedback to his team. They <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffgolenski/status/1352417067849428993\">updated the advertisement</a> to be less fear-inspiring regarding the WordPress plugin ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another potent example of disconnect from the larger community, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-1-adds-feature-suggestions-to-plugin-search-results\">Jetpack 7.1 quietly introduced suggestions to the plugin search screen</a>. The update artificially inserted a search result into the first plugin card slot, identifying the corresponding Jetpack feature if one was available. Jetpack&rsquo;s module placement in the results subtly implied that other plugins were inferior options to its existing modules. Some of the modules advertised required an upgrade. The UI did not make it clear that the artificial search result was not coming from the plugin directory&rsquo;s algorithm. The Jetpack team claimed that it was designed to be a notice but its implementation was virtually indistinguishable from an advertisement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a later release, Jetpack <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-2-1-removes-promotions-for-paid-upgrades-from-the-search-screen\">removed all feature suggestions that previously advertised upgrades</a>, characterizing the mistake as &ldquo;an error in judgment.&rdquo; This kind of misstep could have easily been avoided if the feature had been presented to actual users in advance. User researchers could have asked, &ldquo;How would you like it if we put some of our paid upgrades in the top search spot when you are searching for a new plugin?&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the company has had a few rocky launches where it seemed some product teams did not consider the community&rsquo;s perception in their marketing approaches. Most recently, this was evident in the launch of WordPress.com&rsquo;s new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-rattles-freelancer-community-with-new-website-building-service-launch\">website building service</a>, which failed to include important information, i.e. that the intention was to refer business out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new customer research panel is a strategic move for Automattic and should allow the company to avoid a lot more frustration and miscommunication around Jetpack. It could also be valuable as a means of testing potential marketing angles, beyond just specific features the team is developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When you have a team continually connecting with their customers, you find that they start to become internal ambassadors for the users, helping to weave the user&rsquo;s voice into product and design conversations throughout the entire product design process.&rdquo; Automattic UX/Product Designer Yvonne Doll said in the announcment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to help the Jetpack team realize these goals and become ambassadors for their users, visit the plugin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://jetpackresearch.blog/\">user research blog</a> and sign up to participate in upcoming interviews. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 02:33:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: WP Buffs Finalizes First Acquisition, Purchases WP EZI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110796\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-buffs-finalizes-first-acquisition-purchases-wp-ezi?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-buffs-finalizes-first-acquisition-purchases-wp-ezi\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6915:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Earlier today, WP Buffs <a href=\"https://wpbuffs.com/wp-ezi-acqusition/\">announced that it had acquired WP EZI</a>, a WordPress maintenance and support service. It was a five-figure acquisition for 64 active subscriptions and 343 total customers. Paul Tselekidis, the former owner of WP EZI, is <a href=\"https://wpezi.com/joining-wp-buffs/\">stepping away from the project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Buffs offers 24/7 WordPress website management. Its team works directly with website owners and startups. They also work with white-label partners in the WordPress space. Agencies, freelancers, and hosting companies resell the WP Buffs subscription services instead of hiring a global team of their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first acquisition for the company and was done through their new <a href=\"https://wpbuffs.com/acquisitions/\">Business Acquisition Unit</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For WP EZI users, nothing should change about how they use the service. &ldquo;The day-to-day of the folks at WP EZI (aside from Paul) will continue unchanged as they&rsquo;ve all decided to stay on board and are excited for this new chapter of the business,&rdquo; said Joe Howard, the Founder and CEO of WP Buffs. &ldquo;For the time being, they will continue to function as team members of WP EZI, although they&rsquo;ll, of course, be given a warm welcome as new members of the WP Buffs family.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, none of the pre-acquisition WP Buffs staff will move over to any WP EZI projects or vice versa. The two brands will remain separate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mostly, this is for current WP EZI subscription clients, as keeping them happy and unbothered is our top priority,&rdquo; said Howard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One change coming to WP EZI is that it will no longer offer new care plan subscriptions. The goal is to send those leads to WP Buffs. WP EZI will continue serving current care plan customers and handle one-off projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The strength of WP Buffs is in our strong systems and scalable business model of selling and executing on subscription services,&rdquo; said Howard. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ll continue to accept new care plans there and send all one-time requests to WP EZI. They have experience with this business model, so we&rsquo;re going to keep that team doing the work they&rsquo;ve proved to be strong at.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howard did not give much away in terms of long-term changes. He said that while they are mulling over some ideas, their priorities were a peaceful transition for WP EZI clients and learning from and helping the current team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Most of the benefits for WP Buffs come from acquiring an already profitable business and client base,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Furthermore, the acquisition allows us to funnel care plan leads into WP Buffs and more one-time work into WP EZI. These silos will allow each team to be more efficient since they&rsquo;ll be able to focus on their areas of strength.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>On Acquisitions and Growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On the low end, the deal was likely at least mid to upper-five figures. We know that it was a five-figure acquisition. There were 64 active customers with an $87 per month subscription or more. This also assumes a consistent active subscription count for the last year or so. This is speculation but should provide some low ballpark numbers for others looking to sell a WordPress-related business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Howard did not provide an exact figure, his company provided far more information than is typical of business acquisitions in the WordPress ecosystem. Often, these deals are made only with an agreement that neither party share the sale price. The transparency from WP Buffs should come as a breath of fresh air to other small business owners. It can be overwhelming venturing into a first acquisition from either end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of his goals is to be transparent with how WP Buffs is run. His <a href=\"https://wpbuffs.com/2020-year-in-review/\">2020 year in review</a> post is lengthy, but he does not hold back on mistakes and successes. It provides a lot of insight that other business owners can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howard has some experience scaling businesses beyond that $10,000 &ndash; $15,000 monthly recurring revenue (MRR) spot, which is where some small businesses begin to plateau. I asked him to share his experience with other business owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;WP Buffs now does $100,000+ MRR,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That means we don&rsquo;t have the same issues as a care plan company at the scale of WP EZI &mdash; and if we do, we can pay to make those challenges go away.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WP Buffs now in control of the WP EZI brand, they can dedicate funding where needed and use their leadership and management where needed. Because their team has been here before, it should provide the experience to push past any hurdles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The reality here is just an economics of scale,&rdquo; said Howard. &ldquo;&lsquo;Bigger&rsquo; companies can simply flex a little more muscle to get rid of roadblocks. Plus, they have more financial flexibility to experiment and get things wrong to find that one thing that makes the difference when it comes to growth.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wrapped up his advice by saying that businesses should focus on their subscription metrics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Develop 1-2 predictable, lead acquisition channels and grow those (increase MRR growth from new sales).</li><li>Get a ton of client feedback and make fast adjustments to keep them happy (lower churn).</li><li>From the client feedback, implement new features, offerings, value to current clients so they&rsquo;ll stay with you longer and tell others about you (increase expansion revenue and lifetime value).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;One basic piece of advice is it&rsquo;s never too early to start thinking about selling, even if it&rsquo;s not on your roadmap,&rdquo; said Howard. &ldquo;Whether you ever want to sell your business or not, the things that make the kind of business people want to purchase are the same things that simply make it a good business, so why not do them?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howard and Tselekidis had an <a href=\"https://wpmrr.com/podcast/paul-kidis-wp-ezi/\">open and honest conversation</a> about the acquisition on the WPMRR podcast. Some of it is personal, but it provides a glimpse behind the curtain of a WordPress business sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tselekidis talked about spreading himself too thin among his various projects in the podcast. After a self-analysis and reevaluating his interests, he decided to find a new home for WP EZI. This will allow him to focus on and pursue other goals. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to move on; like it&rsquo;s my time,&rdquo; he said of continuing work that he was not as passionate about. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do a disservice by my clients.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:41:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Matt: Revue Joins Twitter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://ma.tt/2021/01/revue-joins-twitter/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://ma.tt/2021/01/revue-joins-twitter/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:591:\"<p>Very excited to share the <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html\">news that Revue is joining Twitter</a>.

Josepha Haden Chomphosy, the open source project&rsquo;s executive director, published an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2021/01/21/big-picture-goals-2021/\">updated roadmap</a> for 2021 that aims to get an MVP of full-site editing (FSE) in the Gutenberg plugin by April, 2021. FSE v1 would then be on track for shipping with WordPress 5.8, which is anticipated in June, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<table><tbody><tr><th>5.7&nbsp;</th><td>April 2021 &ndash; <strong>MVP for FSE in Gutenberg plugin</strong></td></tr><tr><th>5.8</th><td>June 2021 &ndash; <strong>&nbsp;v1 in Core</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy defined the scope of FSE as &ldquo;the ability to edit all elements of a site using Gutenberg blocks&rdquo; and said it will include &ldquo;all in-progress features designed to help existing users transition to Gutenberg as well.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked what would be considered an MVP of full-site editing, Chomphosy pointed to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24551\">a GitHub issue</a> that contributors are using for tracking all the milestones associated with the project. Part of the infrastructure and UI is marked as complete, as well as browsing between pages, templates, and template parts. Styling, theme blocks, the query block, and the navigation block still need more work. More progress may have been made but the tracking issue has not been updated since December 19, 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dipping into the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/01/22/editor-chat-summary-20th-january-2021/\">notes</a> from the recent editor meetings shows a steady stream of FSE improvements, which presumably will coalesce into an MVP in approximately five weeks. Chomphosy&rsquo;s announcement avoided explicit promises regarding what features are expected at that time.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related projects like the widgets and navigation block editors have new dedicated Slack channels for those interested in following and contributing: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C01D71823PB\" target=\"_blank\">#feature-widgets-block-editor</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C01KDAZJMQ9\" target=\"_blank\">#feature-navigation-block-editor</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have questions about where FSE is headed, an upcoming Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A episode titled &ldquo;<em>Updates on WordPress Site-Editor (FSE) and Themes</em>&rdquo; will feature a panel of people who are actively contributing in these areas. It includes Carolina Nymark, author of <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/\">a course on full site editing and block based themes</a>, Ari Stathopoulos, core contributor and author of the first block-based theme in the repository, and Anne McCarthy, who is managing the FSE outreach experiment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The episode will air live on Friday, January 29th, 2021, at 11AM EST, hosted by Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator of the <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/\">Gutenberg Times</a>. <a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/9716061492351/WN_vtNXZ0zTTs2S0S98X0Y9og\">Registration</a> for the event is free.

In collaboration with Ronald Huereca, who performed the development work, they built a plugin that helps clients jump-start routine, monthly blog posts. In the future, there will be premium &ldquo;content packs&rdquo; that include content for various industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Launch With Words plugin is essentially a JSON importer for blog posts. The plugin itself is simple. However, the idea is what makes this plugin special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The audience is small business owners,&rdquo; said Willard. &ldquo;So many of us in the WordPress ecosystem are overeducated. We are annoyed that clients don&rsquo;t know how to do X, Y, and Z. But that&rsquo;s not their job; it&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Willard wrote starter content for both the Twenty Nineteen and Twenty Twenty default WordPress themes. She said it occurred to her that theme starter content is great, but why was no one tackling this for blog posts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This plugin comes from something I&rsquo;ve been saying to friends for years, &lsquo;launch with words; get paid faster,\'&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<em>Lorem ipsum</em> is such a pain. Seriously. As someone who partners with WordPress agencies and freelancers to write copy for website launches, placeholder text is my nemesis.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Willard <a href=\"https://bridgetwillard.com/\">runs her own business</a>, which offers social media management, copywriting, consulting, and business coaching. She is a marketing consultant who has been writing for the web since 2001.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was a secretary by trade with a background in accounts receivables and collections,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;After I earned my teaching credential, I spent a year teaching junior high and high school math before I realized I didn&rsquo;t like parents. But hey, that bachelor&rsquo;s degree isn&rsquo;t wasted. I decided to go back to office work and landed in accounting (hello, algebra). I excelled in accounts receivable and collections but was at the top of my salary range.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She left the construction industry in 2015 and began working for an advertising agency. During this time, she helped build the GiveWP brand. She also led the WordPress Marketing Team for two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the Plugin Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Importing content with the Launch With Words plugin.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Launch With Words simply imports content. On its own, it does nothing else. Willard provides a downloadable JSON file via the Launch With Words website. This &ldquo;<a href=\"https://bridgetwillard.com/downloads/launch-with-words-starter-content-pack/\">starter pack</a>&rdquo; is available for free to everyone. It includes 12 draft blog posts to keep users blogging on their site for the next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is geared toward freelancers and agencies working with small business owners, anyone can use the plugin and starter pack. If you are having trouble pushing out content regularly, the monthly prompts could be the injection you need to get the creative juices flowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each draft post includes a topic theme, topic type, and blog checklist. The topic theme is centered on usual events or holidays that match the month of the year. For example, the following is the theme for May:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Topic Theme: Summer is around the corner and, if your business is seasonal, you may have a bit of extra time or be swamped. It generally depends on your sales cycle.</p><p>This is a great time to go to your inspiration journal and look for a case study that can be written. Get the content published before people start going on vacations and forget about hiring a small business.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Just pull up each month&rsquo;s draft post, follow the topic, and go from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Draft blog post for December.\n\n\n\n<p>Willard says that the plugin builds off the services she offers. &ldquo;This plugin absolutely solves the repeated issues I encounter with people &mdash; namely, &lsquo;What do I write about?\'&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has not started using the Launch With Words plugin with her clients yet. In the past, she has used the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/BridgetWebQuestions\">Website Content Questionnaire</a>, a tool she built that others can copy to their Google Drive for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;What makes web copy great is having a bit of the backstory about people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What makes them different? Do they like hockey? Did they start working in fast food? Are they building sites for the healthcare industry?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Premium Content Packs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Willard will begin offering premium content packs soon. Each will come with 12 fully-written blog post drafts for each month of the year, catering to specific industries. She plans to launch these individual packs at $497.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I get asked how I come up with prices often,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Because I look at websites and products and SaaS services constantly, pricing is now intuitive to me. It&rsquo;s pretty easy for a developer or a small business to throw down $500 knowing it will give them content for a year. It&rsquo;s a crazy low price. I&rsquo;m not a fan of the word &lsquo;cheap.&rsquo; But this is buying in bulk. This is the Costco model.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blog posts should range between 300 and 500 words, a service in which Willard would generally charge $200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Anyone can tweak the copy to localize it or make it their own,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Before you ask, the only thing worse than duplicate content is no content. It&rsquo;s not novel to offer content; what&rsquo;s novel is to offer content that lives in a blog post. It&rsquo;s not an RSS feed from a syndication service that you can&rsquo;t edit. It&rsquo;s amazing how much franchises pay for boring content to distribute to their networks. Any business should have access to quality content that they can localize.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One has to wonder how Willard could pace herself and produce quality content for these premium packs. However, she is no stranger to the writing process. She has published several books, writing four in the past year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I write to teach,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you boil my essence down, I am a teacher. A few people have encouraged me to publish books. I have two Christian-based books out on Amazon that I did on Lulu.com, but it was so painful, I didn&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was not until she talked with Nathan Ingram, a business coach in the WordPress space, at WordCamp Seattle in 2019 that she decided to give things another go. He introduced her to Kindle Direct Publishing, a driving factor behind her more recent publishing success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;So I took a blog series idea, &lsquo;Dysfunctional Love Songs,&rsquo; and wrote and published that book in April as my COVID project. In October, &lsquo;Keys to Being Social,&rsquo; my life&rsquo;s work was published. &lsquo;The Definitive Guide to Twitter Marketing&rsquo; was written on a Sunday in January. My fourth book, &lsquo;How to Market Your WordPress Plugin&rsquo; is with my editor and will be published this year.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Willard said these writing projects have helped her stay focused on positive things during the Covid-era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Otherwise, it&rsquo;s easy for things to turn dark &mdash; if we&rsquo;re all going to die, why pay off my credit cards? You know? I can&rsquo;t just sit around watching Netflix. I do, but I need an outlet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She does not plan on going it alone for all of the premium content packs. She is already in talks with writers in other fields who would be better suited to the specific subject matter. However, Willard will lean on her construction-related expertise to build some of the packs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The best advice writers give is that you should write what you know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first chapter in Anne Lamott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bird by Bird.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been writing about construction for 20 years. It won&rsquo;t require very much research. I mean, if I can sit down on a Sunday and write 7,000 words on Twitter for that book, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can write 12 blog posts fairly soon.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 21:57:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: Ask the Bartender: How To Bulk Convert Classic WordPress Posts To Blocks?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110841\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:207:\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-how-to-bulk-convert-classic-wordpress-posts-to-blocks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ask-the-bartender-how-to-bulk-convert-classic-wordpress-posts-to-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5513:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was wondering if you could help me. I want to convert all of my old posts (about 600) to Gutenberg blocks. Do you know an easy way to do that?</p><p>Philip</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I often get these short questions via private messages. I always try my best to help other WordPress users whenever I can. This was an easy solution in Philip&rsquo;s case. After a quick chat, he actually learned that he did not need to migrate his posts to the block system. I thought it would be best to open this topic to a wider audience. Maybe it would help someone else along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is currently an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/18645\">open ticket</a> on the Gutenberg repository for a bulk converter. It has sat dormant until a few days ago. The primary argument for including this feature in the plugin and eventually WordPress itself is that the lack of this option is an obstacle for newcomers to the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I disagree with the notion that it is any sort of obstacle for block-editor adoption. There does not seem to be a massive call for the feature in the WordPress support forums. Web searches do not pull up too many support queries for it. It seems to be a niche use case. Or, in some cases, there is a simple misunderstanding that end-users need to do any sort of conversion or migration at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the biggest reason it is a non-obstacle is that posts written in the classic editor are still basic HTML. Regardless of the editor, older content will output just fine on the front end, at least in most cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first question anyone should ask before deciding on bulk converting their old posts to the newer block format is whether they should do it at all. The answer for the majority of users will simply be <em><strong>no</strong></em>. There are few reasons to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing a mass conversion like this, especially with hundreds or more posts, is subject to broken sites. I have done enough single-post updates to know that the process does not always go smoothly. Sometimes, I need to touch up something here or do some manual changes there. On a large scale, there really is no way to know what got broken until you test every single post or page on the site. In some cases, everything is OK. In others, it is a nightmare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are thinking of going down the bulk-conversion route, make a backup first. There is a good chance that you will need it. You should also test this on a staging site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My recommendation for most users is to convert posts on an as-needed basis. I like to make the switch any time I edit an old post. The only reason I convert them is that I prefer working with the block editor over classic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Posts written in the old editor will be in the Classic block. After selecting the block that houses the content, I hit the &ldquo;Convert to blocks&rdquo; button in the block toolbar. I do a quick check of anything that might need to be fixed before hitting the update button.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />&ldquo;Convert to blocks&rdquo; button for the Classic block.\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, there is no reason to convert old posts to blocks except when you are actually editing those posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite claims that things will &ldquo;just work&rdquo; when switching to the block editor, that is not the day-to-day reality of all WordPress users. Some of the biggest reasons I have seen to bulk convert are around theme design issues. For example, the block system made some fundamental changes to image markup. If your theme handles left and right-aligned images added via the block editor but breaks down on your old posts, bulk converting may be an option. However, the first course of action should be checking in with your theme author about adding support for the classic markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are likely numerous other edge cases. Bulk converting posts is an invasive operation that can only be reverted by restoring a pre-conversion backup. It should be a last resort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are at the point where you know you need to convert all your old posts, there are a few options available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-block-converter/\">Bulk Block Converter</a> plugin is likely the most-used solution at the moment. Organic Themes released it a little over a year ago but has only updated it once. User reviews have been mixed. A few of the problems seemingly stem from WordPress &mdash; the plugin extends the core WordPress block converter used in single posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those with clients who want to find a middle ground between bulk conversion and having the client manually convert their old posts, 10up&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/convert-to-blocks\">Convert to Blocks</a> plugin might be the right solution. It converts posts on the fly, only making changes when a user opens the post-editing screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fr&auml;nk Klein is also working on a PHP-based bulk converter plugin named <a href=\"https://bulkconverttoblocks.com/\">Bulk Convert to Blocks</a>. It is currently in the development stage and not ready for use on live sites. It offers a screen in the WordPress admin to perform the conversion and will continue working in the background if the user leaves the page. Because it runs via PHP, developers can extend it with custom actions and filters. It also provides a WP CLI command for those who prefer to work from the command line.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 22:39:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: TasteWP Spins Up Free WordPress Testing Sites in Seconds\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110274\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:177:\"https://wptavern.com/tastewp-spins-up-free-wordpress-testing-sites-in-seconds?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=tastewp-spins-up-free-wordpress-testing-sites-in-seconds\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5318:\"<p><a href=\"https://tastewp.com/\">TasteWP</a> is a newcomer among online WordPress sandboxing solutions. The site allows users to spin up a new WordPress instance in a matter of seconds. Web-based sandboxes like these have been popular for a long time, since they are convenient to fire up and destroy when performing a quick test on a plugin or theme. It&rsquo;s easier than maintaining a local development environment, which many casual WordPress users have not taken the time to set up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>TasteWP&rsquo;s temporary testing sites are hosted for 48 hours for non-logged-in users and 7 days for those who are logged in. The one-click setup gives you a random site URL and login credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The free sites are limited to 220MB per instance. A successful set-up notice is displayed in the dashboard with information on when the site will be automatically deleted. TasteWP limits non-logged-in users to creating 2 sites and the limit is 6 for logged-in users. They can be removed or added within the site manager. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating a new site, the Advanced Options allows users to set up multisite, select a PHP version, WordPress version, and choose from a number of advanced configuration options and pre-installed extensions. The PHP version can also be changed later within the site manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>TasteWP is reminiscent of the now defunct <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/poopy-life-lets-you-create-free-unlimited-wordpress-test-installs\">poopy.life</a> service. In addition to the unsavory and unforgettable name, poopy.life was laden with obtrusive upgrade ads that floated across the screen periodically. TasteWP takes a different route for promotion and includes three of its plugins pre-installed on the default testing sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TasteWP is run by <a href=\"https://inisev.com/\">Inisev</a>, a 15-person company that has been developing&nbsp;WordPress&nbsp;plugins for four years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our key motivator for starting&nbsp;TasteWP&nbsp;was a) scratching our own itch (we needed a platform ourselves to try out new plugin versions on different&nbsp;WP/PHP version combinations) and b) promoting our products,&rdquo; Inisev co-founder Nicolas Ahmann said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Having said that, if there is enough demand (and there seems to be), we&rsquo;ll also offer very affordable premium plans for non-expiring instances with bumped space soon.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahmann said the team is currently funding their projects from their own pockets as well as a few private investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We had some VCs knock at our door recently, and while we don&rsquo;t rule out taking them on board at some point in the future, we feel quite comfortable with our current approach where we grow organically (i.e. without too much ad spending),&rdquo; Ahmann said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, if we had taken on a lot of capital a few years ago, we would have spent a lot of marketing budget on products which weren&rsquo;t ready at the time. Instead, we were forced to make the products better. Limited budgets sharpen your mind immensely.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahmann said the company has several enhancements planned for TasteWP, but they don&rsquo;t want to make the product more complicated to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We developed a Linux application which copies exactly the same moves as user would do to create a website, except that we&rsquo;re omitting the front-end and graphics rendering parts which makes it much easier to process by the computer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Also we inject anything that is needed into the database directly. That allows us to create those sites so fast without preparing them before (but still fully customized for each user).&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is planning to enable users to call specific URLs, such as&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://tastewp.com/?themeslug=slug-of-theme\" target=\"_blank\">https://tastewp.com?themeslug=slug-of-theme</a>,&nbsp;which would spin up an instance with that theme or plugin already installed. This would allow theme and plugin creators to share the link with their potential users/customers so that they can play around themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Localization is also a high priority for future TasteWP enhancements, since the company is based in Europe where many languages are spoken. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We always felt that it doesn&rsquo;t get the attention as it needs, considering that approximately<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language\"> 40% of websites are not in English,</a>&rdquo; Ahmann said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s often just DIY people (not devs) who are trying to create their websites. We always encourage them to learn English (as it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s&nbsp;language). But imagine you grew up in Turkey, for example. Nobody around you speaks English &ndash; the teachers in schools only speak it in a broken way. In those cases it&rsquo;s key that people can take their first&nbsp;WordPress&nbsp;steps in their language, and what&rsquo;s easier to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so than spinning up an instance with one click on&nbsp;TasteWP&nbsp;which is in your language? Long story short: we&rsquo;ll keep translating it into (many) more languages.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 20:47:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 9.8 Brings Rounded Borders To the Group Block and Moves the Site Editor Canvas Into an Inline Frame\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110768\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:283:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-9-8-brings-rounded-borders-to-the-group-block-and-moves-the-site-editor-canvas-into-an-inline-frame?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-9-8-brings-rounded-borders-to-the-group-block-and-moves-the-site-editor-canvas-into-an-inline-frame\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6699:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 9.8 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/01/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-9-8-20-january/\">launched yesterday</a> with a few minor UI improvements. The development team added an initial implementation for border-radius support for the Group block that theme authors can opt into. They also moved the site editor into an iframe element to remove CSS conflicts from the global admin styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who have been testing Full Site Editing should be pleased that they will no longer need to deal with the seemingly never-ending creation of auto-drafts for templates and template parts. <em>Good riddance.</em> They would have inevitably caused user confusion in the long run. The change took around a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/27910\">month of discussion and work</a>, but it reduced a complex and fragile process into a more stable system for the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the previous plugin release saw barely more than a handful of bug fixes, version 9.8 jumped back to over two dozen. A Gutenberg update without at least that many just does not feel right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Minor UI Improvements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The latest version of the plugin improves the UI when working with the Spacer block. When a user selected the block in the past, it appeared as a light gray rectangle. Now, it is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/28103\">semi-transparent. </a>This allows whatever is in the background, such as the Cover block with a background image, to show. This change should help users more easily make size adjustments in cases where viewing the background is necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Semi-transparent Spacer block when selected.\n\n\n\n<p>While I hope the Spacer block will eventually die a slow and agonizing death as it is replaced by more appropriate margin and padding block options, this change does help in the interim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a follow-up to the UI improvements in Gutenberg 9.7, work on block variations continues. Variations are when one block is used as the foundation to create multiple variations of the same block. The most common example is the Embed block, which has YouTube, Vimeo, and other variations. Before 9.7, these variations shared the same generic icon, name, and description in the block inspector and navigation instead of the variation-specific information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 9.8 builds on the trend of using the variation&rsquo;s data where it makes sense. The block switcher (transform) button in the editor toolbar now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/27903\">displays the variation&rsquo;s icon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Variation icon in use in the block switcher.\n\n\n\n<p>It is a small change, but it shows the development team&rsquo;s continued devotion to polishing the editor interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loading the Site Editor Canvas in an iframe</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 9.8 separates the canvas area of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/25775\">site editor into an iframe</a>. This separation means that global admin styles do not bleed into or override styles within the editor itself. The good news is this is a first step toward doing the same in the post editor too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been a change that I have been waiting for since the inception of the block editor. From a theme development and design standpoint, styling the editor to match the front end is ripe with issues. It has meant nesting CSS selectors when it should have been unnecessary. It has meant adding a few <code>!important</code> rules to overwrite what seems like oddities in the core CSS. While styling the block editor has improved by leaps and bounds in the past couple of years, it can still often be a pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core committer Ella van Durpe <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/20797#issue-579381499\">listed the benefits</a> of moving the canvas into an iframe:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>There would be no admin CSS bleed at all. This is something we&rsquo;ve been struggling with since the beginning.</li><li>There would be no need to simulate media queries, which is arguably technically more difficult than using an iframe.</li><li>Relative units like <code>(r)em</code> and <code>vw</code>/<code>vh</code> just work.</li><li>For a full site, a theme stylesheet can be just dropped in the editor without any adjustment. I think this is important as it makes the life of theme authors much easier.</li><li>It&rsquo;s possible to have one selection per window, so one in the admin and one in the content. This is useful for e.g. the link UI where the selection in the content can be kept while the selection is also in an input element (for the URL). Maybe be useful in other cases.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While I find it tough to believe that theme stylesheets would just work without a hitch &mdash; <em>does such a world exist?</em> &ndash;, they should work far better than in the past. There are likely items theme authors will need to contend with, but they should be minimal. Developers should keep a close eye on the future development of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Border Radius Support for the Group Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">As part of Gutenberg&rsquo;s experimental feature set, the Group block now supports a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/27665\">border radius option</a>. However, end-users will not automatically see it in the block inspector. This is an opt-in feature for themes at the moment. Presumably, it will be a part of the default set of options for several blocks in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Setting the border-radius value for the Group block.\n\n\n\n<p>For theme authors who want to add support, they will need to drop the following code snippet into their <code>experimental-theme.json</code> file and edit the <code>radius</code> value:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>\"core/group\" : {\n        \"styles\" : {\n                \"border\" : {\n                        \"radius\" : \"50px\"\n                }\n        }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This will allow theme authors to set the default border-radius for the group block. However, it will not hand over control to users. For that, themes will need to add the following snippet under the <code>settings</code> section of their <code>experimental-theme.json</code> file:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>\"border\" : {\n        \"customRadius\" : true\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested this with a modified version of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">TT1 Blocks </a>theme without issue. Mostly, I am looking forward to more styling options like this in future iterations of the plugin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 22:31:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Thelma Mutete\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=9518\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/01/people-of-wordpress-thelma-mutete/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8322:\"<p><em>WordPress is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/01/Thelma-Mutete.jpg?resize=500%2C750&ssl=1\" alt=\"Thelma Mutete at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-9564\" width=\"500\" height=\"750\" />\n\n\n\n<p>From a young age Thelma was encouraged by her father to ‘work hard, and dream big’. In High School, she pursued a career in Computer Science. She said: “I did not know what I would be doing or how I would get there but I just knew that I was going to pursue a career in information technology.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She wrote her first line of code at the age of 16 living in Zimbabwe, Africa. This was to mark the beginning of her enthusiasm for computer programming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she joined the school’s computer class, Thelma thought she would learn Excel and Word. Instead, the assignment was to write her first program in C. She said: “It was not easy, but it was very exciting. l remember writing up simple code for a Video Club – a check-in/out for VHS tapes and CDs. Thus began my fascination with computers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seven years later, she went on to university to study for a Bachelors in Business Management and Information Technology. Her third year internship was at a local web design and hosting company. Though she had hoped her placement would be at a local bank or telecommunications company, the chance to discover website design turned out to be the best thing that could have happened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, Thelma went on to work for a company designing websites using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and Joomla. She had heard about WordPress but had not used it. She recalls: “People have this misconception that WordPress is not for real developers and it is not secure and at that time I was one of those people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding a local community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a discussion with a member of the local WordPress community, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-opened-whole-new-world/\">Thabo Tswana</a>, about a striking swag gift from a WordCamp, Thelma’s interest was sparked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She started to find out more about WordPress and WooCommerce, and visited her local WordCamp Harare website. She was delighted to find that she could learn more about WordPress without needing any pre-existing knowledge, and wanted to be involved. So instead of just attending the camp, she volunteered too!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her response to her first WordPress event mirrors the experience of many others in the community. She said: “I only started using WordPress because of the awesome people that l had met at that WordCamp. Everyone was so welcoming.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A week later, with help from Thabo, she designed her first website using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She soon became more involved with the community and Meetups. Thelma participated in the first-ever ‘Women Who WordPress’ Meetup in 2018, with lots of women getting involved from bloggers to developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “We were free to talk and discuss a lot of things. We had more time to discuss the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org, we shared views on how to handle discrimination at work, how to promote your website and a whole lot of other things.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Establishing roots in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, WordCamp Harare had its first-ever female Lead Organizer <a href=\"https://tapiwanashe.com/\">Tapiwanashe Manhobo</a>. Thelma was part of the organising team that year and was assigned to handle Harare’s first Kids Camp to take place eight months later. You can read more about her experiences of organizing a <a href=\"https://thelmachido.wordpress.com/2019/11/21/wordpress-juniours-first-edition/\"><strong>Kids Camp</strong></a> on her blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “After the first Kids Camp, we had several people in the local Zimbabwean WordPress community who were enthusiastic about encouraging young people to embrace ICT. In 2019, we had not planned to have a Kids Camp because of financial constraints but to our surprise, we had some anonymous donations and we managed to have a WordPress Community outreach to a youth centre, <a href=\"https://cttzim.org/\"><strong>Centre for Total Transformation</strong></a>, a week after our WordCamp. It is a non-formal school that caters for underprivileged and vulnerable children. The group were able to share practical skills about using WordPress, computer hardware and software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thelma shares that she became hooked on WordPress because of its community. “I enjoy attending WordCamps, meeting new people and just learning new stuff. I have a huge list of WordCamps I would like to attend. Last year I managed to cross WordCamp Johannesburg off my list. When everything is back to normal my plan to travel to WordCamps will proceed (fingers crossed).”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reaping the fruits of ongoing learning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thelma is committed to ongoing development training. She said: “Even though I can still cook up code in C and Java, for now, I have also included WordPress PHP functions to the mix. It was not easy to get to this point, daring myself got me to this slightly better stage. I try to do my best where I can and I am happy to say it has paid off so far.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thelma has continued her journey working in design and digital marketing last year with Trust Nhokovenzo who works in digital marketing and is active in&nbsp; the WordPress Community. He came across her name as a developer from talking with others involved in WordPress. She went to work with his team at a marketing agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her interest in the development of WordPress continued and she joined the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 Release Squad</a> in the mid 2020.&nbsp;At the end of 2020, she moved to become a Happiness Engineer working with WordPress.com. Thelma’s fascination with the platform and the community continues to grow and her contributor story is ongoing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out more about the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Harare-WordPress-Meetup\">Harare WordPress community</a> in Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Nalini Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>) and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>sthakor</a>), Yvette Sonneveld (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>yvettesonneveld</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>lmurillom</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>), and Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>).

Stale bots are usually employed to automatically close &ldquo;stale&rdquo; issues and PRs based on a predefined set of parameters for inactivity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The current recommendation is to set our policy to a 180-day of no activity, so if no comments or commits are on an issue or PR in 180 days, then the bot will post a comment to the issue alerting the user it will be closed in 7-days due to inactivity,&rdquo; Marcus Kazmierczak proposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One important concern is getting the tone right for the automatically-generated message. When you&rsquo;re employing bots on a widely used open source project, they had better be friendly. A chilly, indifferent bot can unwittingly turn away potential contributors with the wrong kind of messaging. Kazmierczak proposed the following message:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This is an auto-generated message to let you know that this issue has gone 180 days without any activity and meets the project&rsquo;s definition of stale. This will be auto-closed if there is no new activity over the next 7 days. If the issue is still relevant and active, you can simply comment with a &ldquo;bump&rdquo; to keep it open, or add the &ldquo;[Status] Not Stale&rdquo; label. Thanks for keeping our repository healthy!</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants in the discussion on the proposal are divided on the best approach. Daniel Llewellyn, one of the most vocal opponents to using a stale bot, contends that an automatically closing issues sends the wrong message. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If we care about users and that they trust that we will fix their problem then automatically closing their issue gives them the signal that we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Llewellyn said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to fix a problem then it is better for a human to explain why the problem won&rsquo;t be fixed and personally close the issue. Automating this on the assumption that because nobody has commented in a while means it isn&rsquo;t important is bad!&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joy Reynolds agreed with this assessment, noting that closing issues through any means can be discouraging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had issues closed by humans for being stale, also, and it isn&rsquo;t any better,&rdquo; Reynolds said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had issues closed because someone created a new issue on the same thing. This loses all the history and the watchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also had an issue closed at Launchpad for being stale (and their system used only two weeks as a time frame). That served no purpose at all. It only makes people go away, frustrated.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kazmierczak reiterated in the comments that the bot can be configured to skip issues labeled as bugs and that issues and PRs can be bumped to reset the 6-month clock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The overall goal of the proposal is to improve feedback and responses to issues by ensuring what&rsquo;s there is relevant,&rdquo; Kazmierczak said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Auto-closing issues is the most controversial part of the plan. The general consensus in the comments leans towards using the bot for labeling and triaging in order to manually close the issue later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;My preference would be for a bot to alert humans in a&nbsp;slack&nbsp;channel when a&nbsp;ticket&nbsp;is declared stale and become progressively more insistent until a human responds,&rdquo; Peter Wilson said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milana Cap suggested using a bot to nudge the ticket author as a compromise between &ldquo;being friendly and thoughtful to contributors while keeping maintainers sane.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever approach contributors land on, excluding tickets marked as bugs is going to be critical for making the stale bot productive. Otherwise, it becomes just a fancy way of kicking the can down the road, delaying the inevitable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent post titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://blog.benwinding.com/github-stale-bots/\">Github Stale Bots: A False Economy</a>,&rdquo; software developer Ben Winding wrote about why stale bots don&rsquo;t deliver what maintainers are aiming to achieve. Based on his experience with the <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues\">Angular</a> repository&rsquo;s bot, Winding summarized the stale bot&rsquo;s effect on the issues queue: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Reduce the metric of&nbsp;<em>Open Issues</em>&nbsp;in github</li><li>Made duplicate issues far more likely</li><li>Increased friction of users reporting that the issue still exists</li><li>Ultimately decreased the quality of the software, as the issues don&rsquo;t accurately reflect reality</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Gutenberg repository&rsquo;s stale bot can be configured not to close bugs and used to maximize human involvement, it will be less likely to deter people from reporting issues. Feedback on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/01/14/stale-issues-in-gutenberg-repository/\">proposal</a> is open until January 29, 2021. Kazmierczak is seeking input on the bot&rsquo;s implementation, specifically its time threshold and messaging.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:03:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"Matt: New WhiteHouse.gov\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=53526\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://ma.tt/2021/01/new-whitehouse-gov/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2842:\"<p>After you&#8217;ve watched <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/inauguration-day-live-updates/2021/01/20/958743170/poet-amanda-gorman-reads-the-hill-we-climb\">the amazing poem from Amanda Gorman</a>, check out the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/\">new WhiteHouse.gov that re-launched today</a> using WordPress &amp; Gutenberg with a number of cool features including dark mode, text zoom, a totally responsive layout, and a Spanish version of the site.

Three of them are largely technical problems, which I covered in previous posts. In wrapping up this series, I want to focus exclusively on the fourth problem, which has a philosophical side as well as a technical one — but that does not mean we cannot tackle it!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Problem Number 4</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"alignwide has-extra-large-font-size\"><strong>Some services work against their customers, and actively prevent site owners from controlling their own content.</strong></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some services are merely inconvenient: they provide exports, but it often involves downloading a bunch of different files. Your CMS content is in one export, your store products are in another, your orders are in another, and your mailing list is in yet another. It&#8217;s not ideal, but they at least let you get a copy of your data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there&#8217;s another class of services that actively work against their customers. It&#8217;s these services I want to focus on: the services that don&#8217;t provide any ability to export your content — effectively locking people in to using their platform. We could offer these folks an escape! The aim isn’t to necessarily make them use WordPress, it’s to give them a way out, if they want it. Whether they choose to use WordPress or not after that is immaterial (though I certainly hope they would, of course). The important part is freedom of choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth acknowledging that this is a different approach to how WordPress has historically operated in relation to other CMSes. We provide <em>importers</em> for many CMSes, but we previously haven&#8217;t written <em>exporters</em>. However, I don&#8217;t think this is a particularly large step: for CMSes that already provide exports, we&#8217;d continue to use those export files. This is focussed on the few services that try to lock their customers in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Should WordPress Take This On?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several aspects to <em>why</em> we should focus on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, it&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/\">the WordPress mission</a>. Underpinning every part of WordPress is the simplest of statements: </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Democratise Publishing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>The freedom to build. The freedom to change. The freedom to share.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These freedoms are the pillars of a Free and Open Web, but they’re not invulnerable: at times, they need to be defended, and that needs people with the time and resources to offer a defence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings me to my second point: WordPress has the people who can offer that defence! The WordPress project has so many individuals working on it, from such a wide variety of backgrounds, we&#8217;re able to take on a vast array of projects that a smaller CMS just wouldn&#8217;t have the bandwidth for. That&#8217;s not to say that we can do <em>everything</em>, but when there&#8217;s a need to defend the entire ecosystem, we&#8217;re able to devote people to the cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it’s important to remember that WordPress doesn’t exist in a vacuum, we’re part of a broad ecosystem which can only exist through the web remaining open and free. By encouraging all CMSes to provide proper exports, and implementing them for those that don’t, we help keep our ecosystem healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have the ability to take on these challenges, but we have a responsibility that goes alongside. We can&#8217;t do it solely to benefit WordPress, we need to make that benefit available to the entire ecosystem. This is why it&#8217;s important to<a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/20/wordpress-importers-defining-a-schema/\"> define a WordPress export schema</a>, so that any CMS can make use of the export we produce, not just WordPress. If you’ll excuse the imagery for a moment, we can be the knight in shining armour that frees people — then gives them the choice of what they do with that freedom, without obligation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Can We Do It?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving on to the technical side of this problem, I can give you some good news: the answer is definitely <em>not</em> screen scraping. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f604.png\" alt=\"😄\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Scraping a site is fragile, impossible to transform into the full content, and provides an incomplete export of the site: anything that&#8217;s only available in the site dashboard can&#8217;t be obtained through scraping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve recently been experimenting with an alternative approach to solving this problem. Rather than trying to create something resembling a traditional exporter, it turns out that modern CMSes provide the tools we need, in the form of REST APIs. All we need to do is call the appropriate APIs, and collate the results. The fun part is that we can authenticate with these APIs as the site owner, by calling them from a browser extension! So, that’s what I’ve been experimenting with, and it’s showing a lot of promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in playing around with it, <a href=\"https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech\">the experimental code is living in this repository</a>. It&#8217;s a simple proof of concept, capable of exporting the text content of a blog on a Wix site, showing that we can make a smooth, comprehensive, easy-to-use exporter for any Wix site owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"904\" height=\"446\" src=\"https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.26.38-pm.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the \" />\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking the export button starts a background script, which calls Wix&#8217;s REST APIs <em>as the site owner</em>, to get the original copy of the content. It then packages it up, and presents it as a WXR file to download.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"972\" height=\"948\" src=\"https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.27.38-pm.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of a Firefox download dialog, showing a Wix site packaged up as a WXR file.\" class=\"wp-image-5528\" />\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really excited about how promising this experiment is. It can ultimately provide a full export of any Wix site, and we can add support for other CMS services that choose to artificially lock their customers in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where Can I Help?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a designer or developer who’s excited about working on something new, head on over to the repository and <a href=\"https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech/issues\">check out the open issues</a>: if there’s something that isn’t already covered, feel free to open a new issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this is new ground for a WordPress project, both technically and philosophically, I&#8217;d love to hear more points of view. It’s being discussed in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/01/19/dev-chat-agenda-for-january-20-2021-january-21-2021/#comment-40563\">the WordPress Core Dev Chat this week</a>, and you can also let me know what you think in the comments!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><em>This post is part of a series, talking about the WordPress Importers, their history, where they are now, and where they could go in the future.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/18/wordpress-importers-stating-the-problem/\">Part 1: Stating the Problem</a></em></li><li><em><a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/19/wordpress-importers-getting-our-house-in-order/\">Part 2: Getting Our House in Order</a></em></li><li><em><a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/20/wordpress-importers-defining-a-schema/\">Part 3: Defining a Schema</a></em></li><li><a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/21/wordpress-importers-free-as-in-speech/\"><em>Part 4: Free (as in Speech)</em></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:14:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: First Round of the FSE Outreach Program Concludes, Identifies Template-Editing Mode Problems\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110638\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:247:\"https://wptavern.com/first-round-of-the-fse-outreach-program-concludes-identifies-template-editing-mode-problems?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=first-round-of-the-fse-outreach-program-concludes-identifies-template-editing-mode-problems\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5309:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Full Site Editing (FSE) <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/help-steer-the-future-of-wordpress-via-the-fse-outreach-program\">Outreach Program</a> has now concluded its <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/01/15/fse-program-template-editing-testing-summary/\">first round of testing</a>. Its first focus area was centered on the template-editing mode introduced in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/12/23/whats-new-in-gutenberg-23-december/\">Gutenberg 9.6</a>. The volunteers involved with the project identified several pain points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 9.6 added a new button that allows end-users, provided they are using a block-based theme, to switch between editing their post and the template that displays the post. As Josepha Haden <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-9-3-provides-indicator-of-where-full-site-editing-is-going-a-future-without-widgets-and-customizer-screens\">said last year</a>, the ultimate goal is to &ldquo;consolidate down to just one beautiful, intuitive interface.&rdquo; Essentially, this new feature merges content and design in a way we have not seen in core WordPress before. It is a step toward that lofty goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, WordPress has always separated content from design. However, these two aspects of websites are continually merging together. There is a desire for this. The adoption of page builders over the last half-decade or so has made it abundantly clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest issue with this new template mode is that users need a working knowledge of the WordPress template system to understand the ramifications of their edits. One of the primary questions of the focus area was whether it was clear that the user was making large-scale changes to all posts when switching to the template-editing mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe it was not clear enough how those changes could impact the site,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2020/12/23/fse-program-testing-call-1-template-editing/#comment-1307\">wrote H&eacute;ctor Prieto in response</a>. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t already know how templates, template parts, and global blocks like Site Title work, you might not understand how your editing will affect the rest of the site.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching modes does create a quick popup at the bottom left of the screen that reads:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Editing template. Changes made here affect all posts and pages that use the template.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to miss before it fades away. There is a ticket to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28175\">stick this message</a> on the screen and allow the user to dismiss it. There is also another ticket for clarifying when a user is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27849\">editing a template vs. content</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Entering template-editing mode from the post editor.\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg&rsquo;s current method is different than what you might see in a typical page builder. When switching to template-editing mode, the user is no longer editing that single post&rsquo;s front-end output. Instead, they are making global edits. A page builder would generally save any customizations to that page alone. If this remains the same, it could be a hurdle for the average user to clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A template creation feature needs to be a part of this new mode. Users should be able to fork or clone their existing single post template and save it as a new template specific to that post. Or, maybe hand them a way to save it as a reusable template (i.e., &ldquo;page&rdquo; template). Paal Joachim Romdahl <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2020/12/23/fse-program-testing-call-1-template-editing/#comment-1303\">shared a similar thought</a>, likening it to the &ldquo;Save As&hellip;&rdquo; feature commonly found in computer programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do question whether users should be able to edit global templates while editing a single post. The two are only related insofar as the template displays the post content on the front end. WordPress should explore any type of design work from the post-editing screen as, first and foremost, specific to that post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The volunteers also identified other issues. Applying changes to the template and saving drops the user back into the post editor. The &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; button is tough to find &mdash; it is in a different location than where the user clicked to go into template-editing mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching between post and template editing feels like an FSE 2.0 type of thing. The development team has enough issues on its plate with the normal site editor. It is a far cry from being a viable, production-ready product. The team&rsquo;s focus should be on working the kinks out of that system before merging it with the post editor. Crawl before you walk. Walk before you run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I am willing to be pleasantly surprised. In the long run, it will probably be a good thing that we are getting an early look at what these two different pieces of WordPress will look like working in conjunction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also why participation in the FSE Outreach Program is vital. The community needs this more formal type of process to identify areas that need improvement.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 23:17:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"HeroPress: Changing Careers Into WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=3454\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:136:\"https://heropress.com/essays/changing-careers-into-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=changing-careers-into-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6844:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/012021-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: With WordPress skills, you have more concrete skills to offer.\" /><p>If you’re looking to change careers into technology, WordPress is a great way to do it.</p>\n<p>In 2013, I was in a career counselor’s office. Just realizing that I needed to change careers out of music, almost the only thing I had known for the last 20 years:</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/trombone-namm.jpg\"><img /></a>At NAMM in Anaheim, California\n<p>Aside from feeling like a huge failure, I knew I’d need a lot of luck to get a job.</p>\n<p>Someone would have to take a big chance on me.</p>\n<p>But there were a few problems.</p>\n<p>I was terrified of talking to strangers, much less asking them big favors. And I had almost no traditionally useful skills.</p>\n<p>Enter WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Lots Of Options</h2>\n<p>When you’re changing careers, you’ll want skills that will help no matter what you end up doing.</p>\n<p>You don’t want to deep-dive into calculus and find out that it won’t help.</p>\n<p>Learning WordPress is perfect.</p>\n<p>If you get really interested in the technical side, you can be a JS or PHP developer.</p>\n<p>If you really like content creation, that’s also great. You can start a blog or work in marketing.</p>\n<p>If none of it interests you, at least you can help people set up a website as you look for another career.</p>\n<p>So soon after meeting with the career counselor, I took Zac Gordon’s course on WordPress Theme Development.</p>\n<p>I wrote a theme based on his course, and really liked how WordPress worked.</p>\n<p>He taught me to build sites, and later write plugins.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/with-zac-gordon.jpg\"><img /></a>Zac Gordon with XWP\n<h2>Invite Yourself To The Party</h2>\n<p>The great thing about WordPress is that you can contribute right away.</p>\n<p>With some careers, you need somebody to take a chance on you before you can do much.</p>\n<p>To get experience as an investment banker or business consultant, you probably need to actually have the job.</p>\n<p>But with WordPress, you can invite yourself.</p>\n<p>You can open pull requests to Core or Gutenberg without anyone asking.</p>\n<p>You can deploy plugins to wp.org that real people use, without having a college degree.</p>\n<p>With this growing experience, I applied online to <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a>.</p>\n<p>Weston Ruter responded right away, and was really helpful.</p>\n<p>I started opening simple PRs to “help” with the Customizer work.</p>\n<p>In reality, my work might have slowed things down, and was really simple.</p>\n<p>But I didn’t have to wait to be invited. I invited myself to the party, and one of the PRs was merged into Core.</p>\n<p>Later, when I interviewed with <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a> and got the job, I could show that I had a little experience working with other developers.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/with-xwp-1.jpg\"><img /></a>XWP At WordCamp US Contributor Day, 2017\n<p>It’s still embarrassing looking back at the work I did. But WordPress allows you to contribute, regardless of your experience level.</p>\n<p>Years later, when I lived in Mexico City, one of my friends got interested in technology.</p>\n<p>He was like me. He had a degree in an unrelated field, and wanted a great career.</p>\n<p>So I showed him how much opportunity WordPress has.</p>\n<p>He did something similar to what I did.</p>\n<p>He opened PRs to an agency’s repos, and the agency asked him if he wanted to talk about a job, without him needing to apply. Years later, he’s still doing really well at his job.</p>\n<p>I did very little, other than point him to a huge opportunity: WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Concrete Skills</h2>\n<p>Changing careers is really awkward.</p>\n<p>You read about networking, which seems like you’re asking strangers for favors and sending spam DMs.</p>\n<p>You also learn to reframe things as transferable skills.</p>\n<p>So if you’ve done hard things, you can say you’re “comfortable with ambiguity.”</p>\n<p>But with WordPress skills, you have more concrete skills to offer.</p>\n<p>It’s less awkward explaining to someone why they should take a chance on you.</p>\n<p>You’ve shown you’re committed to your career path by your portfolio of plugins.</p>\n<p>And you don’t have to send spam DMs on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>In 2014, I went to my first WordPress meetup, <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WPLosAngeles\">WordPress Los Angeles</a>. I was nervous, but I wasn’t trying to take any value.</p>\n<p>I could even answer a few questions.</p>\n<p>Renee Johnson and I met there. We even reunited in WordCamp Europe and Mexico City several years later when I lived there:</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/with-renee.jpg\"><img /></a>Yani Jimenez and Renee Johnson, Mexico City\n<p>With WordPress skills, you can flip from taking to giving value. Everything is much less awkward.</p>\n<p>As you probably know, there are many self-taught developers in WordPress.</p>\n<p>College degrees rarely come up in hiring conversations, at least in my experience.</p>\n<p>And I’ve found WordPress very accepting of different career backgrounds. Matt Mullenweg was a musician, famously naming every release after a jazz musician.</p>\n<p>People in WordPress are very understanding about changing careers.</p>\n<p>Now, I don’t hide it, and it’s rarely more than a footnote in conversations.</p>\n<h2>Mentorship</h2>\n<p>Don’t go it alone.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to think that you can just take online courses and eventually be ready for a job.</p>\n<p>But code reviews are one of the main ways you’ll learn. And people in WP want to help.</p>\n<p>If you contribute a few PRs to someone’s GitHub repo, they’ll probably do a quick code review of your own plugin or theme.</p>\n<p>Weston was really helpful in doing a detailed review of my theme.</p>\n<p>You also can learn a lot contributing to Gutenberg or other plugins.</p>\n<p>They’ll give you detailed reviews. And you’ll basically get the same experience as if you were getting paid.</p>\n<p>But if I were to do this again, I’d also look for more formal mentorship.</p>\n<p>Hiring someone to review your plugins and themes would probably help.</p>\n<h2>Nothing To Fix</h2>\n<p>There’s a saying in marketing “what you can’t fix, you feature.”</p>\n<p>In WordPress, you don’t have to fix your non-traditional career background.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/changing-careers-into-wordpress/\">Changing Careers Into WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 17:50:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Ryan Kienstra\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"Gary: WordPress Importers: Defining a Schema\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://pento.net/?p=5495\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://pento.net/2021/01/20/wordpress-importers-defining-a-schema/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8792:\"<p>While schemata are usually implemented using language-specific tools (eg, XML uses <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/standards/xml/schema\">XML Schema</a>, JSON uses <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\">JSON Schema</a>), they largely use the same concepts when talking about data. This is rather helpful, we don&#8217;t need to make a decision on <a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/19/wordpress-importers-getting-our-house-in-order/\">data formats</a> before we can start thinking about how the data should be arranged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note: Since these concepts apply equally to all data formats, I&#8217;m using &#8220;WXR&#8221; in this post as shorthand for &#8220;the structured data section of whichever file format we ultimately use&#8221;, rather than specifically referring to the existing WXR format.</em> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is a Schema Important?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s fair to ask why, if the WordPress Importers have survived this entire time <em>without</em> a formal schema, why would we need one now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two major reasons why we haven&#8217;t needed one in the past:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WXR has remained largely unchanged in the last 10 years: there have been small additions or tweaks, but nothing significant. There&#8217;s been no need to keep track of changes.</li><li>WXR is currently very simple, with just a handful of basic elements. In a recent experiment, I was able to implement a JavaScript-based WXR generator in just a few days, entirely by referencing <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/includes/export.php\">the Core implementation</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These reasons are also why it would help to implement a schema for the future:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>As work on WXR proceeds, there will likely need to be substantial changes to what data is included: adding new fields, modifying existing fields, and removing redundant fields. Tracking these changes helps ensure any WXR implementations can stay in sync.</li><li>These changes will result in a more complex schema: relying on the source to re-implement it will become increasingly difficult and error-prone. Following Gutenberg&#8217;s lead, it&#8217;s likely that we&#8217;d want to provide official libraries in both PHP and JavaScript: keeping them in sync is best done from a source schema, rather than having one implementation copy the other.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking the time to plan out a schema now gives us a solid base to work from, and it allows for future changes to happen in a reliable fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WXR for all of WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a well defined schema, we can start to expand what data will be included in a WXR file.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Media</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, many of the challenges around media files are less to do with WXR, and more to do with importer capabilities. The biggest headache is retrieving the actual files, which the importer currently handles by trying to retrieve the file from the remote server, as defined in the <code>wp:attachment_url</code> node. In context, this behaviour is understandable: 10+ years ago, personal internet connections were too slow to be moving media around, it was better to have the servers talk to each other. It&#8217;s a useful mechanism that we should keep as a fallback, but the more reliable solution is to include the media file with the export.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Plugins and Themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two parts to plugins and themes: the code, and the content. Modern WordPress sites <em>require</em> plugins to function, and most are customised to suit their particular theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For exporting the code, I wonder if a tiered solution could be applied:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Anything from WordPress.org would just need their slug, since they can be re-downloaded during import. Particularly as WordPress continues to move towards an auto-updated future, modified versions of plugins and themes are explicitly not supported.</li><li>Third party plugins and themes would be given a filter to use, where they can provide a download URL that can be included in the export file.</li><li>Third party plugins/themes that don’t provide a download URL would either need to be skipped, or zipped up and included in the export file.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For exporting the content, WXR already includes custom post types, but doesn&#8217;t include custom settings, or custom tables. The former should be included automatically, and the latter would likely be handled by an appropriate action for the plugin to hook into.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Settings</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a currently handful of special settings that are exported, but (as I just noted, particularly with plugins and themes being exported) this would likely need to be expanded to included most items in&nbsp;<code>wp_options</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Users</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the bare minimum information about users who’ve authored a post is included in the export. This would need to be expanded to include more user information, as well as users who aren’t post authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WXR for <em>parts</em> of WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The modern use case for importers isn&#8217;t just to handle a full site, but to handle keeping sites in sync. For example, most news organisations will have a staging site (or even several layers of staging!) which is synchronised to production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s well outside the scope of this project to directly handle every one of these use cases, we should be able to provide the framework for organisations to build reliable platforms on. Exports should be repeatable, objects in the export should have unique identifiers, and the importer should be able to handle any subset of WXR.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WXR Beyond WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until this point, we&#8217;ve really been talking about&nbsp;WordPress→WordPress migrations, but I think WXR is a useful format beyond that. Instead of just containing direct exports of the data from particular plugins, we could also allow it to contain &#8220;types&#8221; of data. This turns WXR into an intermediary language, exports can be created from any source, and imported into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s consider an example. Say we create a tool that can export a Shopify, Wix, or GoDaddy site to WXR, how would we represent an online store in the WXR file? We don&#8217;t want to export in the format that any particular plugin would use, since a WordPress Core tool shouldn&#8217;t be advantaging one plugin over others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it would be better if we could format the data in a platform-agnostic way, which plugins could then implement support for. As luck would have it, <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">Schema.org</a> provides exactly the kind of data structure we could use here. It&#8217;s been <a href=\"https://schema.org/docs/releases.html\">actively maintained for nearly nine years</a>, it supports a <a href=\"https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html\">wide variety of data types</a>, and is intentionally platform-agnostic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gazing into my crystal ball for a moment, I can certainly imagine a future where plugins could implement and declare support for importing certain data types. When handling such an import (assuming one of those plugins wasn&#8217;t already installed), the WordPress Importer could offer them as options during the import process. This kind of seamless integration allows WordPress to show that it offers the same kind of fully-featured site building experience that modern CMS services do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, reality is never quite as simple as crystal balls and magic wands make them out to be. We have to contend with services that provide incomplete or fragmented exports, and there are even services that deliberately don&#8217;t provide exports at all. In the next post, I&#8217;ll be writing about why we should address this problem, and how we might be able to go about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><em>This post is part of a series, talking about the WordPress Importers, their history, where they are now, and where they could go in the future.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/18/wordpress-importers-stating-the-problem/\">Part 1: Stating the Problem</a></em></li><li><em><a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/19/wordpress-importers-getting-our-house-in-order/\">Part 2: Getting Our House in Order</a></em></li><li><em><a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/20/wordpress-importers-defining-a-schema/\">Part 3: Defining a Schema</a></em></li><li><a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/21/wordpress-importers-free-as-in-speech/\"><em>Part 4: Free (as in Speech)</em></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 23:13:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"WPTavern: Custom Layouts Plugin Creates a Posts Display System for Both the Classic and Block Editors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=110409\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:247:\"https://wptavern.com/custom-layouts-plugin-creates-a-posts-display-system-for-both-the-classic-and-block-editors?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=custom-layouts-plugin-creates-a-posts-display-system-for-both-the-classic-and-block-editors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5383:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Ross Morsali, via his brand Code Amp, released the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-layouts/\">Custom Layouts</a> plugin last week. The plugin&rsquo;s goal is to provide a visual post layout builder for users of both the block and classic editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For end-users, this is yet another choice between the multitude of plugins for displaying posts. After years of new plugins launching in this space, it would seem that there would be a clear front-runner, but developers are still trying to tame this wild and complex feature. The Custom Layouts plugin has its own approach, and it is worth giving it a quick spin to see if it suits you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have written extensively about the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-9-6-introduces-drag-and-drop-blocks-and-global-inheritance-for-the-query-block\">upcoming Query block</a> and its role in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/understanding-the-query-block-and-its-importance-in-site-editing\">future of WordPress</a>. However, it is necessary to look at alternative solutions for displaying posts via the block editor. The Gutenberg development team should take note of the things that work and those that do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers, the plugin is a noteworthy experiment that uses the block editor component system outside of the actual editor. Custom Layouts uses these various components on its custom Layout and Template Editor screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is a product of Morsali learning React and the block system in the last year and a half. &ldquo;Working with Gutenberg and the Block Editor as a developer is a far superior experience to the old paradigm (the classic editor) &mdash; the learning curve is definitely greater, but once you get over the hump it seems the future is bright,&rdquo; he wrote in the <a href=\"https://codeamp.com/creating-the-custom-layouts-plugin/\">plugin&rsquo;s announcement post</a>. &ldquo;I also love the fact that we don&rsquo;t actually need to be using the Block Editor to use Gutenberg components &mdash; that means we can still build what we want and how we want it (providing we&rsquo;re using React), whilst keeping the UI in tune with the rest of WordPress.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the Plugin Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Template editor screen.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Custom Layouts takes a different route than similar plugins, splitting its components into different screens. The terminology can be confusing to the uninitiated. The plugin introduces two parts that serve as the foundation of its system:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Templates:</strong> Handles the design of individual posts.</li><li><strong>Layouts:</strong> Controls queried posts and their layout.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I have had a beta version of the plugin since late December. This has given me three weeks to decide whether I like the approach. On the one hand, the plugin caters to two different user bases. One set can implement their layouts via the Custom Layouts block. Those on the classic editor can use the Layout Editor screen. Both share the Template Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a three-column grid layout.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&rsquo;s system is a good option for users of the classic editor. It comes with a visual interface they would otherwise not have. It also provides a shortcode for easy copying/pasting into the post editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For users of the block editor, having a separate screen for the template builder will likely feel unnatural. Because the block editor is a visual interface itself, the multiple screens create a disjointed atmosphere that never feels <em>right</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is a solution for that in the plugin. I recommend users skip the Template Editor and Layout Editor screens altogether. The Custom Layouts block serves as an alternative layout builder in the block editor. Plus, users can edit existing templates via a popup overlay or even create new ones without ever leaving the post-editing screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />Overlay for editing a template.\n\n\n\n<p>Building everything from the post editor feels like it should feel. Users get more of that instant feedback that they are accustomed to through the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are benefits to the multi-component system. Separating the template builder means that users can build and reuse a specific design from a single source. They can also update individual templates, which will subsequently apply to all uses of those templates across the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other benefit is that end-users are not overloaded with choices. Building a query-related block, widget, shortcode, or similar component is fraught with complexity. This is because there are three pieces of laying out a list of posts: the query to load them, the overall layout, and the design of the individual posts. Putting options for each of these pieces into the block inspector, for example, means creating a balance between sacrificing some choices and providing every possible setting to the user. This balancing act is what drove Morsali toward separating the components of the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, Custom Layouts is a solid plugin. The downside is that there is a little bit of a learning curve because it serves two audiences. Users will need to figure out which workflow best suits them first. Once they figure that out, the plugin is pretty nice to work with.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 21:48:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 06:17:14 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 06:00:08 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20201016112008\";}', 'no');
